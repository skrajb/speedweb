Every day is a fresh chance to become better than yesterday for example reading ten pages daily may seem small but after one year it turns into powerful knowledge your mind set decides your direction for example thinking I can improve leads to action while doubt creates delay The new resolution I choose to live by is not just a yearly promise but a deep commitment to reshape the way I think act and grow because a meaningful resolution is not created for motivation alone but for discipline purpose and long term transformation I decide that this year I will move forward with clarity courage and consistency no matter how slow the progress feels because slow growth is still growth and standing still is the only real failure this resolution begins with responsibility where I accept that my future is shaped by my daily choices not by luck not by excuses and not by waiting for perfect conditions for example when I delay my goals saying tomorrow I lose today but when I act now even imperfectly I gain momentum this year I resolve to focus on effort rather than outcome. Success grows quietly before it becomes visible for example consistent effort shows results after patience success I choose to stop fearing failure because failure is not the opposite of success but a part of the process for example when an entrepreneur faces losses early they learn lessons that later protect them from bigger mistakes this resolution also includes mastering self-discipline where I train myself to do what is necessary even when motivation is low because motivation is temporary but discipline creates permanent results for example waking up early to work on a skill daily may feel hard but over time it becomes identity

Hard days are part of the journey not the end of it for example athletes train hardest when results are not visible I resolve to speak positively to myself because inner dialogue shapes outer reality for example when I say I can improve instead of I am not capable my actions follow belief this resolution includes emotional maturity where I respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively because calm decisions create better outcomes for example choosing silence during conflict often preserves dignity and long term respect I will stop comparing my journey with others because comparison steals peace and distorts progress for example two people walking different paths cannot measure distance the same way I choose to measure growth against my past self because becoming better than yesterday is real success this year I will build consistency because consistency turns ordinary actions into extraordinary results for example writing one page daily leads to books knowledge and mastery I resolve to embrace discomfort because comfort rarely produces growth. Learn to be patient because strong results take time for example trees grow slowly but last for decades learning a difficult skill initially feels uncomfortable but later becomes a strength I will practice patience because meaningful results take time and rushing often creates regret for example a tree grows slowly but stands strong for decades I choose honesty with myself because self-awareness is the foundation of improvement for example admitting weakness allows correction whereas denial creates stagnation I will act with integrity because character is built when no one is watching for example choosing honesty even when it costs short term gain builds long term trust this resolution also includes gratitude because appreciation multiplies happiness

New Resolution, when framed professionally represents a Strategic commitment to continuous improvement rather than a temporary Surge of motivation and its true value lies in the discipline and clarity it brings to daily actions for example an Educator who resolves to enhance teaching effectiveness by adopting one new method each month gradually builds a stronger learning environment and professional credibility similarly a student who commits to structured daily study instead of last minute preparation develops focus, confidence and long term academic stability, effective resolutions are rooted in realism and purpose because achievable goals encourage consistency while unrealistic expectations lead to disengagement for instance allocating a fixed manageable time each day for skill development is far more sustainable than setting excessive targets that disrupt balance professional growth through resolutions also requires accountability and reflection because reviewing progress allows refinement of Strategies; like a professional who evaluates weekly performance can identify strengths and areas for improvement without Self-Criticism, challenges and setbacks should be approached analytically rather than emotionally, as they provide insight into better planning and execution, for example missing a scheduled task should prompt adjustment of workflow instead of abandonment of the goal, motivation alone is insufficient in professional settings therefore discipline and structured habits play a critical role in maintaining momentum during low energy phases such as continuing essential tasks even when enthusiasm is reduced a positive and solution oriented Mind-set further strengthens resolutions by enabling adaptability and resilience like viewing feedback as an opportunity to improve rather than a judgment, patience is equally important because professional excellence develops over time through sustained effort, much like mastering a Complex Skill that initially shows slow progress but yields significant results with persistence,

Middle Eastern cultures are known for their Elaborate Hospitality traditions and poetic heritage; while European Cultures have shaped global thought through centuries of philosophical, artistic, and scientific innovation. Each culture no matter how big or small contributes something valuable to the mosaic of global civilization. Culture is also dynamic rather than static. It changes with time, influenced by migration technological advancement globalization, and social transformation. Historical events such as Colonization wars trade routes and revolutions have reshaped cultural landscapes bringing together diverse groups and sparking new cultural expressions. In today&apos;s Interconnected world cultures interact more than ever before. Globalization has opened pathways for cross-cultural exchange allowing people to explore music, films, fashion, literature, and cuisine from different parts of the world withinseconds. While this interConnectedness promotes understanding and appreciation it also raises concerns about cultural dilution loss of indiGenous practices and the dominance of certain Global cultures over local traditions. Balancing modernization with cultural preservation has therefore become one of the great challenges of our time. Culture does not only Influence societies on a macro level it also has a profound impact on personal identity. From early childhood individuals absorb cultural norms and expectations that shape their beliefs manners language and worldView. Culture provides a sense of belonging grounding individuals in a heritage that connects them to their ancestors and to their community. For many cultural traditions become a source of pride and emotional strength offering comfort during difficult times and joy during Celebrations. Festivals for Instance are vibrant cultural expressions that mark seasons honor deities celebrate harvests and commemorate historical events.

Health and exercise are deeply connected aspects of human life that together form the foundation of a balanced, active, and disease-free lifestyle, and in today&apos;s modern world, where sedentary habits, stress, and unhealthy eating are common, their importance has increased more than ever before. Health does not only mean the absence of illness but a complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being, and regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to achieve and maintain this state. Exercise refers to any physical activity that improves or maintains physical fitness, such as walking, running, yoga, cycling, swimming, stretching, or playing sports, and even simple activities can produce powerful health benefits when practiced consistently. For example, a person who walks briskly for 30 minutes every day experiences better blood circulation, improved heart function, and increased energy levels compared to someone who spends most of the day sitting. Regular exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system by making the heart more efficient at pumping blood, which reduces the risk of heart diseases, high blood pressure, and stroke, and this is why doctors often advise patients with heart-related issues to adopt light but regular physical activity. Exercise also plays a major role in maintaining a healthy weight, as it helps burn excess calories and boosts metabolism; for instance, a person who combines daily exercise with a balanced diet is more likely to maintain a healthy body weight than someone who relies only on dieting without physical activity. Apart from weight management, exercise improves muscle strength, bone density, and joint flexibility, which is especially important as people age, because strong muscles and bones reduce the risk of fractures, arthritis, and mobility problems; for example, elderly individuals who practice light exercises like yoga or stretching often remain more independent and active in daily life.

Ancient India stands as one of the most remarkable and enduring civilizations in human history flourishing across thousands of years from the prehistoric era to the decline of the % Gupta Empire around 600 CE. Its origins trace back to early human settlements during the Stone Age when people lived in caves hunted animals and gradually learned to cultivate land and domesticate animals. The transition to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods saw the rise of settled agricultural communities like MEHRGARH where early evidence of wheat cultivation and cattle rearing emerged. This slow yet steady progress in human organization and craftsmanship laid the foundation for the first great urban civilization of the subcontinent the Indus Valley Civilization: also known as the Harappan Civilization. The Indus Valley Civilization which thrived between 3300 BCE and 1500 BCE was one of the world&apos;s earliest examples of planned urban development. Its cities Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro Lothal and Kalibangan featured well-laid streets advanced drainage systems public baths, granaries and standardized weights and measures. The people were skilled artisans who worked with metals, beads and seals and they traded extensively with regions like Mesopotamia. Religious life seemed to revolve around the worship of nature and fertility symbols such as the Mother Goddess and Pashupati an early form of Lord Shiva. Although the script of this civilization remains UNDECIPHERED its art architecture and craftsmanship demonstrate a sophisticated society the civilization eventually declined possibly due to environmental changes, river shifts or invasions giving way to a new era in Indian history the Vedic Age. The Vedic period, spanning from around 1500 BCE to 600 BCE began with the arrival of Indo-Aryan tribes who settled along the rivers of Northwestern India

Happiness is the gentle light that brightens the darkest corners of life, a force that transforms ordinary moments into extraordinary memories. It is not merely a fleeting emotion but a profound state of being that shapes how we perceive the world and ourselves. In a world that often feels rushed and demanding, happiness stands as a reminder that joy is not found in the noise of achievement but in the quiet embrace of gratitude, love and purpose. True happiness is not about having everything; it is about appreciating what we have and finding meaning in every breath we take. It is the art of turning challenges into lessons and setbacks into stepping stones toward growth. When we choose happiness we choose to rise above negativity and embrace the beauty that life offers even in its imperfections. At its core happiness is deeply personal yet universally desired. It is not a destination marked on a map but a journey that unfolds with every choice we make. Many people chase happiness in material possessions believing that wealth status or luxury will unlock the door to lasting joy. Yet history and experience teach us that happiness thrives not in abundance but in simplicity. It blooms in the laughter shared with loved ones, in the warmth of a sunrise and in the peace that comes from knowing we are enough. Happiness is not about escaping reality it is about embracing it with courage and optimism. It is the ability to find light even when clouds gather, to dance in the rain when storms threaten and to believe that every challenge carries the seed of a brighter tomorrow. Philosophers and thinkers across centuries have pondered the essence of happiness offering wisdom that still resonates today. Aristotle spoke of eudaimonia a life of virtue and purpose as the highest form of happiness. His words remind us that happiness is not passive it demands effort reflection and alignment with our values.

Giddha is one of the most vibrant, expressive, and culturally rich folk dances of Punjab, representing the soul and spirit of Punjabi womanhood and capturing within its lively movements the essence of joy, freedom, laughter, strength, and everyday life. This dance form performed exclusively by women has been a cherished part of Punjabi tradition for centuries passed down from generation to generation as an artistic expression that celebrates femininity community storytelling and cultural memory. When Punjabi women perform Giddha they do not merely dance they give voice to their emotions reveal their social experiences and express their inner vitality in a free and spirited manner. The core beauty of Giddha lies not only in the graceful movements but especially in the boliyan the short witty, rhythmic verses sung aloud by the performers. These boliyan act as windows into Punjabi village life, capturing everyday stories teasing humor domestic relationships marital experiences, social observations and even subtle critiques of societal norms. Through these verses women communicate their happiness, frustrations, expectations wit and wisdom transforming Giddha into a platform for artistic expression and emotional release. Many of these boliyan are centuries old preserved in oral tradition while others are created spontaneously on the spot adding freshness and excitement to every performance. This improvisational nature of Giddha makes it a living, evolving art form that adapts to time while retaining its traditional charm. Historically, Giddha is believed to have emerged from ancient women&apos;s dances associated with seasonal festivities agrarian celebrations harvest rituals and community gatherings. Long before modern entertainment existed women in Punjabi villages would come together in courtyards fields and open spaces to sing, dance, and share life&apos;s experiences through Giddha

Artificial Intelligence has rapidly evolved from a niche scientific concept to one of the most transformative forces shaping the future of human civilization, touching almost every aspect of Daily Life, Professional Growth, Education, Innovation, Communication, and personal development. At its core, AI refers to the capability of machines to mimic Human Intelligence Learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding languages, recognizing patterns, and making decisions but the practical impact it creates today goes far beyond that simple definition. AI has become a companion that assists people in tasks that traditionally required human thinking, making complex processes simple, time-consuming tasks faster, and previously impossible tasks completely achievable. The influence of AI starts from the smallest activities of everyday life, such as setting reminders, organizing personal SCHEDULES, guiding navigation while travelling, responding to messages, helping with quick calculations, summarizing long documents, and even suggesting what to watch or read next, and extends to larger responsibilities like handling business decisions, analyzing huge data sets, predicting trends, and automating workflows that once demanded the constant attention of multiple skilled workers. For students, AI becomes a private tutor available 24 hours a day, ready to explain any concept at any level of difficulty using multiple methods examples, analogies, visual explanations, step-by-step breakdowns, or real-life applications. It helps with homework, creates notes, answers conceptual questions, prepares revision summaries, generates sample questions, evaluates assignments, and even simulates exam environments to measure performance. In professional environments, AI has become a backbone for productivity, decision-making, and workflow optimization.

Ravi grew up in a small village where mornings began before sunrise and dreams often felt heavier than the stones he carried to the nearby river for his father&apos;s work yet inside him lived a quiet determination that refused to fade. His family struggled to make ends meet, and education was considered a luxury, but Ravi believed it was his way forward, even when studying meant reading borrowed books under a dim oil lamp after long hours of labor. Every day was a test of endurance as he balanced school, work, and responsibility far beyond his age, facing exhaustion, hunger, and constant doubt from those who believed survival mattered more than ambition. Many times he failed exams misunderstood lessons and felt the sting of embarrassment when classmates laughed at his worn clothes but instead of surrendering he chose to learn from each setback using failure as fuel rather than a reason to quit. His dedication was not loud or dramatic it was shown in small consistent effortswaking early to revise notes asking teachers questions despite fear and practicing problems repeatedly until they made sense. The struggle taught him patience as progress was slow and success seemed distant but it also taught him resilience reminding him that growth often happens silently before it becomes visible. When his father fell ill, Ravi nearly gave up school to work full-time yet he pushed harder believing that enduring hardship now could change his family&apos;s future. Years passed with sacrifices that went unnoticed but each challenge strengthened his resolve and shaped his character. Finally when Ravi earned a scholarship to continue his studies the achievement felt less like a sudden victory and more like the natural result of years of unwavering commitment.

A zoo is a specially designed place where wild animals are kept under human care for the purposes of conservation, education, research, and public awareness, and in the modern world it plays a very important role in connecting humans with wildlife. In earlier times, zoos were mainly collections of animals owned by kings and rulers to show their power, such as Mughal emperors keeping lions or exotic birds in royal gardens, but today the concept of a zoo has completely changed and now focuses on animal welfare and environmental responsibility. A modern zoo tries to recreate natural habitats for animals, for example, instead of keeping a tiger in a small cage, zoos now design large forest-like enclosures with trees, water pools, and hiding spaces so the tiger can behave naturally by walking, resting, and playing as it would in the wild. One of the most important roles of a zoo is wildlife conservation, especially for endangered species whose numbers are rapidly decreasing due to deforestation, climate change, and illegal hunting; for instance, animals like the giant panda, white rhinoceros, and certain species of deer have survived mainly because of breeding programs run by zoos across the world. These breeding programs are carefully planned to maintain genetic diversity, and animals are sometimes exchanged between zoos in different countries, such as giraffes being moved from one zoo to another, to prevent inbreeding and ensure healthy offspring. Zoos also act as strong educational centers where students and visitors learn about animals, their habitats, and the importance of protecting nature, and this learning becomes more effective because people can see real animals instead of only reading about them in books; for example, when a child watches an elephant using its trunk to eat food or spray water, the child understands animal behavior much better than through pictures alone.

Culture is one of the most profound aspects of human existence, shaping the ways individuals think, communicate, celebrate, remember, and understand the world, and it serves as the invisible thread that binds communities together across time and space. Culture is not limited to art, music, language, or rituals alone; it is the collective expression of human life an evolving tapestry woven from shared beliefs, customs, values, traditions, symbols, social norms, and collective memories. It influences how societies function, how relationships are formed, and how identities are constructed. When people speak of culture, they often envision vibrant festivals, traditional clothing, folklore, literature, or religious practices, yet culture extends far beyond these visible forms. It exists in everyday actions such as the way people greet one another, how they organize their homes, how they raise their children, the foods they prepare, the stories they tell, and even the unspoken assumptions they make about morality or social behavior. Culture defines what is considered polite, sacred, beautiful, heroic, acceptable, or forbidden; it shapes the rhythm of daily life and the milestones of an individual&apos;s journey birth, marriage, death, and everything in between. The richness of global culture lies in its diversity, as every society offers its own unique blend of customs and traditions. This diversity is not merely a surface-level variation but a deep reservoir of human wisdom, creativity, and resilience. Around the world, thousands of languages, countless art forms, distinct architectural styles, diverse cuisines, and unique belief systems reflect the endless range of human imagination and adaptation. For example, traditional African cultures celebrate community living and oral storytelling as a means of preserving history; East Asian cultures emphasize harmony, discipline, and respect for ancestors; Indigenous cultures across the Americas are deeply rooted in their connections to nature and spirituality;

Time management is not merely about creating a schedule or filling up a planner with long lists of tasks. It is a mindset, a method of approaching our day in a disciplined, intentional, and thoughtful manner. Many people fail not because they lack talent or ambition, but because they spend their time reacting instead of planning, drifting instead of deciding, and racing instead of focusing. To master time management, one must first acknowledge that time is a limited resource. Every minute wasted is gone forever, while every minute invested holds the power to create results, skills, and progress. The most effective individuals prioritize tasks based on importance rather than urgency. Urgency tricks us into believing that immediate action equals meaningful achievement. Importance reminds us that long-term impact matters more than short bursts of activity. Successful students, professionals, and entrepreneurs often begin their day by tackling their most meaningful task first, a technique known as &quot;eating the frog.&quot; It eliminates procrastination and builds momentum for the rest of the day. Another essential principle in time management is the power of routines. Morning and evening routines create structure, reduce decision fatigue, and help maintain focus. When we automate small parts of our life, such as planning the next day before bed or reviewing our goals every morning, our brain is free to devote energy to creativity, learning, and problem-solving. Equally important is learning to say no. Many people overload their schedules because they fear disappointing others. But every &quot;yes&quot; to a low-value activity is a &quot;no&quot; to something meaningful. Protecting your time means protecting your future. Breaks are not the enemy of productivity; they are fuel for the mind. Short intervals of rest enhance concentration, prevent burnout, and boost creativity. Even the world&apos;s top performers follow cycles of work and rest. Ultimately, time management is life management. When you manage your time well, you create space for growth, happiness, learning, and relationships. It is not about doing more but about doing what matters most. Every day gives us twenty-four hours. Some build dreams with them. Others let the hours pass quietly. The difference lies not in time, but in how we choose to use it.

Continuous learning is the foundation of modern success. In a rapidly changing world, where technology evolves each second and new opportunities appear daily, the willingness to learn has become more valuable than degrees, wealth, or background. Education does not end with school or college; true learning continues throughout life. The people who advance, innovate, and lead are those who stay curious and determined, treating every day as a chance to become better than before. Learning today is easier than at any other point in history. With online courses, tutorials, books, virtual libraries, and expert communities, knowledge is available at our fingertips. A smartphone and a desire to grow are enough to build skills that once required expensive classrooms. Yet continuous learning is not simply about collecting knowledge; it is about practicing, experimenting, applying ideas, and refining skills through experience. Humility is essential in this journey. A person who believes they already know everything stops growing. Successful learners are humble enough to ask questions, courageous enough to try new things, and strong enough to learn from failure. Mistakes are not setbacks; they are steppingstones. Every struggle builds resilience and wisdom. Reading is one of the most powerful habits for self-development. Books allow us to absorb years of insight in a matter of hours. Conversations with knowledgeable people expand our perspectives. Online communities help us connect, collaborate, and solve problems together. The world is a classroom for those who choose to observe and engage. Like muscles, the brain strengthens when challenged. Small daily efforts, whether in coding, writing, language, analysis, or leadership, compound into expertise. Continuous learning builds confidence, sharpens thinking, opens opportunities, and fuels growth. The day we stop learning is the day we stop rising. Stay curious, stay humble, and success will follow with quiet certainty

In a recent article, &quot;English need not be the medium of instruction in higher education institutions&quot;, published in Sunday Guardian Live, Jagadesh Kumar, former Chairman of the UGC and former Vice-Chancellor of JNU, argues that the belief that English is essential for global communication and better job prospects has marginalised Indian languages in education. Citing the NEP 2020, which emphasises teaching in Indian languages as a key step toward greater inclusivity, Kumar calls for reducing English&apos;s dominance and highlights the challenges rural students face in coping with English. He argues that they should be allowed to take exams in their native language. The provocative title raises important questions. While it is true to an extent that using English as the medium of instruction can hinder students&apos; understanding of key concepts especially for those with limited English skills is it wise to argue that English should not be the medium in higher education institutions? Inspiring example I have come across numerous engineering students who initially struggled to understand and communicate in English. But the determined boy steadily improved his English skills, which boosted both his confidence and academic performance. While working full-time, he mastered design software and prepared rigorously for the GATE exam, ultimately securing an All India Rank of 16 and admission to IIT-MadrasEnglish is the global lingua franca. Proficiency in English has empowered millions of Indians to acquire knowledge and skills, succeed in higher education and their careers, compete with professionals worldwide, demonstrate expertise across diverse fields, and actively participate in the global economy. Moreover, strong English skills are a key requirement in the workplace. An English-medium education at the tertiary level significantly improves chances of securing better job opportunities.

Life is a Journey filled with Challenges, Victories, dreams, and endless possibilities. Every person on this planet holds within them a fire a spark of greatness that can transform ordinary existence into Extraordinary achievement. The most powerful truth about life is that success does not depend on luck or circumstances; it depends on mindset, belief, and consistent effort. The moment you decide to believe in yourself, you take the first step toward greatness. Many people fail not because they lack talent, but because they doubt their own potential. The World will try to limit you, people will discourage you, and situations will test you, but the one thing that must remain UNSHAKEN is your self-belief. Confidence is not Arrogance: it is faith in your ability to learn, to rise, and to keep going despite obstacles. &quot;Success is never about avoiding failure but about learning how to rise after every fall.&quot; True Success demands persistence. Life will often test your patience, your Willpower, and your Emotional Strength. There will be days when you feel like giving up, when nothing seems to go right, when every door appears closed. But those who persist, who keep walking even when the path is dark, are the ones who eventually reach their destination. Think of Colonel Sanders, who faced over a thousand rejections before someone believed in his chicken recipe. His story shows that persistence is more powerful than talent or luck. When you keep trying, you build momentum, and with momentum comes Success. No great dream- was ever achieved overnight; it takes years of dedication, discipline, and faith. Motivation might get you started, but discipline keeps-you-going. Discipline means doing what you know is right, even when you don&apos;t feel like it. It means waking up early, working hard, and staying consistent. The small daily habits you build today determine the greatness you achieve tomorrow.

The human mind is the most powerful tool you have. If you fill it with positive thoughts, it will guide you toward success; if you fill it with doubt, it will lead you astray. Positivity is not about Ignoring reality but about focusing on possibilities instead of limitations. Oprah Winfrey was once told she wasn&apos;t fit for television, yet her positivity turned rejection into strength. She became one of the most influential women in the world. Positive thinking gives you the Courage to act, the patience to endure, and the WISDOM to see light in the darkest times. Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass; it&apos;s about learning to dance in the rain. Every Challenge, every hardship, and every failure prepares you for something greater. Courage is the bridge between dreams and achievement. Nothing worthwhile ever happens inside your comfort zone. Growth begins when you step into the Unknown. Elon Musk risked everything to create Space-X and Tesla when most people called him crazy. Today! he has changed the world because he dared to dream beyond fear. Courage does not mean the absence of fear; it means acting despite it. Every time you face fear, you grow stronger. The more risks you take, the more opportunities you create. Change may feel uncomfortable, but it&apos;s the only way to progress. Those who adapt and embrace change thrive, while those who resist it stay stuck. Life keeps evolving, and so must you. The key is to trust the process and believe that everything happens for a reason. Like a seed planted deep underground, Success takes time to sprout. You may not see the results immediately, but with patience, they will bloom.

A morning walk is usually taken early in the day, often at dawn, when the air is fresh, pollution is minimal, and the surroundings are calm and quiet, making it an ideal time for physical exercise and mental freshness; for example, a person who wakes up at 5:30 a.m. and goes for a walk in a nearby park experiences cool air, chirping birds, and rising sunlight, which naturally energizes the body and prepares the mind for the day ahead. Morning walks help regulate the biological clock of the body, improve digestion, boost metabolism, and enhance blood circulation, which is why doctors often recommend morning walks to people suffering from obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart-related problems; for instance, a diabetic patient who walks briskly for 30 to 45 minutes every morning often notices better blood sugar control compared to someone who remains inactive. Morning walking also supports mental health, as exposure to early sunlight increases the production of serotonin, a hormone responsible for happiness and emotional stability, so people who regularly go for morning walks usually feel more positive, focused, and less stressed throughout the day. In addition to physical and mental benefits, a morning walk builds discipline and time management skills because waking up early and maintaining a routine requires consistency; for example, a student who develops the habit of morning walking often becomes more punctual and organized in studies and daily tasks. On the other hand, an evening walk is usually taken after completing the day&apos;s work, often around sunset or after dinner, and it serves as a relaxing activity that helps release the stress and fatigue accumulated during the day; for example, an office worker who spends long hours sitting in front of a computer may feel mentally exhausted, but a peaceful 20 to 30 minute evening walk helps relax muscles, refresh the mind, and improve mood.

Humanity&apos;s fascination with the Moon has evolved from poetic musings to rigorous scientific inquiry, revealing a satellite far more dynamic and complex than the lifeless orb we once imagined. Recent analyses of Apollo relics using modern techniques have shown that Space weathering driven by solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts produces Nanophase Iron particles on Lunar Soil grain rims, darkening ultraviolet reflectance in ways crucial for interpreting far-UV mapping data from instruments like the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&apos;s LAMP, designed to detect water ice in shadowed craters. Seismic exploration has also reshaped our understanding: researchers scrutinizing imagery and Apollo-era sample sites found evidence that shallow Moonquakes attributed to tectonic activity along faults such as the Lee-Lincoln scarp have occurred in the Taurus-Littrow valley within the past 90 million years. These small-scale thrust faults indicate that tectonic contraction and orbital tidal forces remain active, prompting a Re-Evaluation of lunar interior dynamics and future landing site regulations. The presence of volatiles, particularly Water Ice in permanently shadowed polar craters, has galvanized efforts to design specialized instrumentation: NASA&apos;s Artemis program will deploy the Lunar Terrain Vehicle Equipped with AIRES and L MAPS sensors to map both surface minerals and subsurface ice to depths of over 40 meters. On the Surface, NASA&apos;s SLAP initiative will deploy DUSTER and SPSS payloads to characterize dust and plasma interactions near the lunar south pole, addressing challenges posed by abrasive regolith and charged dust that compromise habitats and spacesuits. These efforts are sparking urgent calls for updated International Legal Frameworks, as Countries like China plan crewed landings by 2030 and India&apos;s ambitious Chandrayaan 5/LUPEX mission coordinated with JAXA, NASA, and ESA prepares to probe Polar Volatiles with advanced Instrumentation.

Good Habits are the key to a Happy and Successful Life. They help us become better people and achieve our goals in a smooth and disciplined way. A Habit is something we do regularly, often without thinking. When habits are good, they help us grow. When they are bad, they hold us back. That is why it is important to learn and practice good habits from a young age. One of the most important good habits is PUNCTUALITY. Being on time shows that we are serious, responsible, and respectful of others. Whether it is going to school, attending a meeting, or catching a bus, being punctual helps us make the most of our time. Time is precious, and when we manage it well, we can do many things in a day. People who are always late often miss opportunities and make a poor impression. Discipline means doing what is right even when we don&apos;t feel like it. It helps us stay focused and follow rules. A disciplined person does not give up easily and keeps trying until they succeed. In school, discipline helps students complete their homework, follow instructions, and behave well.

Life is the most precious gift we have. It is the Journey, we all go through from birth to death, filled with experiences, lessons, emotions, and memories. Everyone&apos;s life is different, but we all have something in common the desire to live happily, find purpose, and make the most of our time on earth. Life is not just about growing up, going to school, working, and growing old. It is about discovering who we are, understanding our STRENGTHS and weaknesses, learning from our mistakes, and building meaningful relationships. Life gives us chances every day to improve ourselves, help others, and enjoy the beauty around us. From the moment we are born, we begin to learn. As children, we learn how to walk, talk, and interact with the world. Our family teaches us love, kindness, and discipline. As we grow, we go to school, meet friends, and discover our interests. School plays a big role in our lives, teaching us not just ACADEMIC Knowledge, but also how to work with others, manage time, and deal with challenges. Life becomes more beautiful when we learn to enjoy these little things. Stress, pain, and sadness are also part of life, but they are not permanent. Earthquakes often bring a serious risk of flooding, due to the fact that they can destroy natural or manmade barriers that hold water in place. Dams can be weakened to the point of failure, or toppled entirely, by an earthquake. The Water, previously restrained by the dam, will immediately follow gravity&apos;s path to lower ground, submerging, damaging, or sweeping away anything in its path.

Earthquakes along the ocean floor can cause tsunamis, giant tidal waves bringing immense destruction to coastal areas they hit. A similar phenomenon, called a seiche, can occur on lakes. Although! SEICHES are usually smaller than tsunamis, they are still capable of destroying lakefront property if the earthquake has sufficient force. Fires Earthquakes can also cause fires by pulling down power lines, ripping apart gas pipes, or toppling wood burning stoves or fireplaces. Although the resulting fires can vary in severity, their effect is often worsened as the earthquake disrupts emergency crew ability to extinguish them. The most obvious danger brought by earthquakes is shaking ground. Depending on its intensity, this motion itself can damage or destroy building materials, which get stretched and bent beyond their tolerances. The ground&apos;s movement can take the form of waves running along the surface of the ground. As the wave runs under a building, the structure can lean, potentially tipping over. Then, when the shaking stops, the ground often settles to a different level compared to where it was previously, causing buildings, roads, and other structures to become unstable, topple, or break apart. <LIQUEFACTION> is particularly common in places with sandy soil and groundwater at shallow depths in the soil. Displacement along Fault Lines When an area containing a fault line gets hit by an earthquake, the land can break into new masses, separated by the fault line. Structures that were built across the fault will then be cleaved apart. If a road, for example, happens to cross the fault line, it can be sliced apart at the fault, with the two new pieces separated by a chasm or even pushed past each other, depending on the movement of the earth&apos;s plates. As the soil firms, the building will stop settling and come to rest in its altered position.

Friends we make during this time often stay with us for life and help us understand the value of trust and support. Life teaches us many lessons outside of books. We learn to deal with failures, disappointments, and Setbacks. Not everything in life goes as planned, and that is okay. Failure is not the end but a step toward Success. Every time we fall, we have a chance to rise again, stronger and wiser. These Experiences make us mature and teach us to stay strong in difficult times. They also help us understand that problems are a part of life, and how we face them defines who we are. One of the most important things in life is relationships. Our family, friends, teachers, and even strangers we meet all play a role in our Journey. Life becomes meaningful when we share it with others. Helping someone, showing kindness, or simply listening to someone&apos;s problems can bring great joy. Being kind and respectful to others creates a positive environment and brings peace to our own hearts. When we build strong relationships based on trust and love, we create a support system that helps us through the ups and downs of life. Life is also about personal growth. Infrastructure is the network of power, telecom, ports, airports, roads, Civil Aviation, railways, and transportation in a country. Its importance in the development of a Country cannot be over-emphasised. As a matter of fact infrastructure is the lifeline of the economy of a country. All developed countries have adequate infrastructure so that all the activities are executed efficiently, smoothly in time. On the other hand, all poor countries have little infrastructure. The plans of these countries target the building of adequate infrastructure to put their economies on a high growth path

Diversity exists everywhere around us, from nature, where different species of plants and animals coexist, to human communities, where people differ in appearance, beliefs, customs, and experiences, yet live together and contribute to society in unique ways. For example, a single classroom may include students from different cultural backgrounds, speaking different languages at home, following different traditions, and having different learning styles, yet all of them study together, share ideas, and grow through mutual interaction. Cultural diversity enriches societies by allowing people to learn from one another, as food, music, clothing, festivals, and art from various cultures come together to create a vibrant and dynamic environment; for instance, a city that celebrates festivals like Diwali, Eid, Christmas, and Vaisakhi allows people to understand and respect different beliefs while enjoying shared happiness. Diversity also strengthens creativity and innovation, because when people with different perspectives work together, they generate more ideas and better solutions; for example, in a workplace where employees come from different educational, cultural, and social backgrounds, problem-solving becomes more effective as each person approaches challenges differently. Diversity promotes tolerance and empathy by teaching individuals to respect differences rather than fear them, which reduces prejudice and discrimination and builds stronger, more peaceful communities; for instance, when people interact regularly with others who are different from them, they become more open-minded and understanding. Language diversity is another important aspect, as different languages carry unique histories, emotions, and ways of expression, and preserving linguistic diversity helps protect cultural identity; for example, multilingual societies encourage communication across cultures while also preserving regional and indigenous languages.

Power is an essential input for economic development and improving the quality of life of people. Development of conventional forms of energy for meeting the growing needs of people is the responsibility of the government. In the pre- independence period, the power supply was mainly in the private sector and that too restricted to the urban areas. With the formation of State Electricity Boards during the Five-Year Plans, a significant step was taken in bringing about a systematic growth of power supply for industries all over the country. A number of multi-purpose projects came into being with the setting up of hydro, thermal and nuclear power stations. India at present is at the threshold of becoming a developed country. With the increase in population the demand for goods and services is increasing every year. The number of dwelling units in big and small cities is increasing. There is more demand for power to run home appliances in these as well as existing units. To meet this ever increasing demand we need to build a huge power infrastructure. That is why India has entered into a nuclear deal with America whereby the sole superpower in the world shall provide us with nuclear technology. Many nuclear reactors will be set up in India. The transportation infrastructure includes roads, vehicles, railways, tracks, trains, ports, airports, ships and vessels. Road transportation is perhaps the most important because the railway tracks cannot be laid everywhere. The roads are the means by which the movement of people and goods from one place to another is ensured.

According to an estimate approximately eight million Indians are living in countries of the world. Although America, France, England, Australia are their favourite countries, and middle-east and south-east Asia are their other favourite regions, the persons of Indian origin are scattered in all parts of the world. They are in several countries of Africa, the Scandinavian countries, Benelux countries, and the Caribbean island countries. In some countries they have mixed with the locals in such a way that at times it is difficult to differentiate them. In some nations, they have been living now for the last 2-3 generations assimilating local culture, language, habits and customs. Most of the Indians who are either working abroad or have permanently settled abroad have kept their roots intact. They are highly patriotic and love India as much as the resident Indians do. A vast majority of the people who have gone abroad from various parts of India have left their parents and other close relatives like brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, grandparents, etc. at their native place. Such Diasporas have properties and other assets in India and keep on sending money to their parents/ relatives regularly. They have opened various kinds of Non- Resident Accounts in different banks. Many well-off Non-Residents are participating in the private business ventures directly and indirectly. The current boom in India&apos;s share market, to some extent is due to the bulk share purchase of various listed companies by the NRIs. This is indirect participation in Indian industries. Some listed public sector enterprises are also favourite of these investors. It is also said that many NRIs are buying residential and commercial properties in India. The diaspora is particularly interested in buying offices, chambers and shops in multiplexes in metropolitan cities, state capitals, district centres and other major cities in India.

Dimensions on the Importance of Transformational Leadership in Education Educational institutions need leaders that would confront the status quo and use their power to deal with power imbalances in schools and communities. An effective leader must be willing to use the authority of democracy if he is to achieve an institution improvement. Leadership is a crucial element concerned with creating conditions in which institutional reforms can succeed including improving students learning and institution&apos;s image. Effective leaders are found to exercise an indirect but powerful influence on the effectiveness of the institution and on the achievement of students. Traditionally, a principal&apos;s role performance involves focusing on institutional goals, the curriculum, instruction and creating conducive institutional environment. The principal focuses on enhancing teacher&apos;s performance and on the behaviours of teachers so as to enable teachers to engage their students in learning activities which ultimately focus on helping students learn. Thus, principal&apos;s leadership is thought to be instrumental in bringing about institutional effectiveness. This traditional approach to leadership is known as instructional leadership. The term instructional leadership emerged from institutional effectiveness research in the 1980s. However, instructional leadership suffers from some drawbacks. Dimmock (1995) asserts that instructional leadership is too prescriptive and relies on a top-down process of management. This type of structure supports the view that when principals accomplish vital tasks, teaching and learning improve. He suggests that institutions are characterized by loose coupling and autonomy and a better strategy would be a bottom-up approach.

Heritage Fair is much more than an academic project or a School event it is a powerful celebration of culture, identity, history, and the lived experiences that shape communities across generations, and it serves as a bridge connecting the youth to the traditions and stories that define who they are and where they come from. At its core, a Heritage Fair invites students to EMBARK on a personal and Intellectual Journey, Encouraging them to explore meaningful historical topics, cultural practices, family traditions, community narratives, or significant figures that have impacted their heritage this exploration, students not only gather facts but also learn to appreciate the Complexities, Struggles, accomplishments, and values embedded in their cultural backgrounds. As they research, interview family members, analyze primary and secondary sources, and collect photographs, documents, or artifacts, they uncover layers of meaning that transform their understanding of identity. The creation of the final project whether it takes the form of a display board, a model, a scrapbook, a multimedia presentation, or a reenactment becomes an opportunity for creativity and self-expression. Students learn to organize information, design visually engaging presentations, and communicate their findings with clarity and confidence, which strengthens lifelong skills such as public speaking, critical thinking, collaboration, and the ability to synthesize information. The actual day of the Heritage Fair becomes a vibrant space filled with colour, dialogue, storytelling, and shared pride, as participants set up their displays, answer questions, and engage visitors in conversations about the Cultural or Historical subject they have studied. It is often during these interactions that students realize the true power of heritage: it brings people together, sparks curiosity in others, creates Empathy for different experiences, and fosters respect for cultural diversity

The proposed backward mapping would begin with student-outcomes and then progress through the following: learning styles and processes, teaching strategies, institutional organization and structure, leadership, management, resources and culture/climate. Dimmock further suggests that this framework and strategy would help institutions and communities address the challenge of providing leadership and management for quality teaching and learning. Essentially, the student is the centre of institutions, which are deeply concerned with quality of institution and principals and teachers must focus on improving student learning and performance. Leadership within this paradigm is based primarily on a strong technical knowledge of pedagogy/andragogy and secondly, on curriculum design, development and evaluation. Saving money is also a habit that can help us in the future. We should learn not to waste money on unnecessary things. Instead, we can save a little every day or week. This money can be used in times of need or for something important later. Saving teaches us patience and planning. It is a habit that even grown-ups must follow to lead a stable life. In the modern world, using technology wisely is a new good habit we must learn. Mobile phones, computers, and the internet are useful, but we should not spend too much time on them. Too much screen time can harm our eyes and reduce our focus. We should use gadgets for learning and communication, but not become addicted to games or social media.

Education is the highway to that goal. Prevelance of Child labour: All non-school going children are child workers in one form or the other. Agricultural child labour constitutes the core of the problem. Child labour policies and education policies have to be formulated and operated in tandem. Parents do want to send their children to be educated and poverty as a limiting factor is highly OVER+RATED. Motivation and availability of infrastructure rather than poverty are the key factors. The paper underlines the strengths of formal education in eradicating child labour and forcefully argues for a legislation to provide for compulsory education. The main argument against child labour and compulsory education is that it is necessary for the wellbeing of the poor as the state is unable to provide relief. The second argument, is that education would make the poor unsuited: for the kind of manual work that is required to be done. The third argument is that certain industries would be forced to close down if they did not have the facility of the low wage child labour.

Liberty is one of the most enduring and complex ideas in human thought, a concept that has animated revolutions, shaped constitutions, inspired art and literature, and guided the moral imagination of individuals across cultures and centuries, yet it remains elusive, contested, and perpetually unfinished in its realization; at its core, liberty refers to the condition in which individuals possess the capacity to think, choose, speak, and act without undue coercion, but this simple formulation conceals layers of philosophical, political, and social meaning that vary depending on historical context and human experience, for liberty is not merely the absence of chains or the removal of tyrants, but the presence of conditions that allow human potential to flourish with dignity and responsibility. From the earliest civilizations, people have struggled against domination, whether imposed by kings claiming divine authority, empires enforcing obedience through violence, or social hierarchies that confine individuals by birth, gender, caste, or race, and these struggles reveal that liberty is inseparable from power, because to be free is always to negotiate the limits of authority and the distribution of control within a society. Classical thinkers such as Aristotle distinguished between living as a slave and living as a citizen, suggesting that liberty required participation in public life, while later philosophers like John Locke framed liberty as a natural right inherent in the individual, grounded in reason and consent rather than tradition or force, a shift that profoundly influenced modern democratic thought. Yet even as liberty was proclaimed as universal, it was often denied in practice, most starkly in the coexistence of liberty rhetoric with slavery, colonialism, and exclusion, reminding us that liberty has historically

At the same time, driving demands a high level of concentration, as a driver must continuously observe the road, monitor traffic signals, respond to unexpected situations, and make quick yet safe decisions; for instance, a responsible driver slows down near schools and residential areas, anticipating pedestrians and children crossing the road. Learning to drive is a gradual process that includes understanding traffic rules, mastering vehicle control, and developing confidence through practice, because theoretical knowledge alone is not enough without real-road experience. Safe driving habits such as wearing seat belts, following speed limits, maintaining proper distance from other vehicles, and avoiding distractions are crucial for preventing accidents and protecting lives; for example, using a mobile phone while driving significantly reduces reaction time and increases the risk of collisions, which is why many accidents occur due to distracted driving. Driving also requires emotional control, as anger, impatience, or stress can lead to rash decisions like aggressive overtaking or sudden braking, which endanger not only the driver but also others on the road; for instance, a calm driver who allows another vehicle to pass avoids unnecessary conflict and reduces accident risk.

Transformational leadership in education is often described as a process in which leaders work collaboratively with teachers, students, and the wider community to build a shared sense of purpose. Rather than relying only on positional authority, transformational leaders seek to inspire others through vision, commitment, and mutual trust. In contemporary schooling environments, such leaders recognize that simply maintaining existing routines is insufficient when students’ needs and societal expectations continue to evolve. They therefore commit themselves to ongoing institutional learning, encouraging staff to reflect critically on current practices and to experiment with new approaches that may enhance student achievement. A transformational leader strives to develop the professional capacity of teachers by fostering collegiality, shared problem solving, and open communication. In this sense, leadership becomes a distributed activity rather than the responsibility of a single individual. When teachers feel supported and respected, they are generally more motivated to engage in innovative instruction and to respond constructively to student diversity. Importantly, transformational leadership is grounded in ethical considerations, including fairness, transparency, and social justice. Educational institutions do not operate in isolation; they are influenced by community expectations, economic realities, and cultural norms. Leaders who understand these dynamics are better positioned to guide meaningful change. Although transformational leadership can be demanding, it provides a powerful framework for improving educational outcomes. By cultivating shared values, encouraging collaboration, and modeling professional integrity, transformational leaders create learning environments that are inclusive, adaptive, and forward-looking.

In recent decades, the field of educational leadership has increasingly emphasized the significance of vision-driven practice. Transformational leadership is distinguished by the capacity to articulate a compelling vision that resonates with both staff and students. This vision does not merely describe an ideal future; it also provides direction for everyday professional actions. Effective leaders translate broad aspirations into achievable goals, aligning organizational structures, professional development initiatives, and resource allocation with clearly defined priorities. One of the central features of transformational leadership is the nurturing of teacher leadership. When teachers are empowered to participate in decision-making processes, they become active contributors to institutional growth rather than passive recipients of administrative directives. Such empowerment strengthens professional identity and enhances teachers’ sense of ownership over instructional improvement. In turn, students benefit from classrooms characterized by enthusiasm, creativity, and intellectual curiosity. Transformational leadership also acknowledges that change is a continuous and complex process. Leaders must be able to manage uncertainty, address resistance, and sustain momentum over time. This requires resilience, emotional intelligence, and the capacity to build supportive professional relationships. While traditional administrative models sometimes prioritize control and compliance, transformational leadership focuses on inspiration, motivation, and capacity building. As a result, educational institutions become learning communities in which all members are encouraged to grow. Ultimately, transformational leadership provides a pathway for educational reform that honors both academic excellence and human development.

Educational institutions today face diverse challenges, ranging from technological change to shifting societal expectations regarding equity and inclusion. Transformational leadership has emerged as a particularly relevant approach in this context because it emphasizes adaptability and shared responsibility. Leaders who adopt this approach encourage reflective dialogue about teaching practices, assessment strategies, and student support systems. They recognize that improving learning outcomes requires collective engagement rather than isolated administrative action. Central to transformational leadership is the idea of modeling desired behaviors. Leaders demonstrate commitment to lifelong learning by engaging in professional study, seeking feedback, and acknowledging their own areas for growth. This stance creates a culture in which continuous improvement is valued and mistakes are treated as opportunities for learning. Teachers in such environments are more likely to experiment with innovative pedagogies, integrate technology thoughtfully, and tailor instruction to diverse learning needs. Another important dimension is relational trust. Transformational leaders invest time in building authentic relationships with stakeholders, including parents and community partners. Transparent communication and ethical decision-making enhance the credibility of leadership actions, making it easier to mobilize support for institutional initiatives. Rather than imposing reforms from above, leaders work collaboratively to co-construct solutions that reflect local contexts. As educational systems continue to evolve, transformational leadership remains a dynamic and responsive orientation that aligns organizational change with broader social values.

The concept of transformational leadership highlights the moral and professional responsibilities of educational leaders in shaping institutional culture. Rather than concentrating solely on administrative efficiency, transformational leaders seek to cultivate environments in which teachers and students feel valued, respected, and inspired to excel. Vision, collaboration, and personal example form the foundation of this leadership style. Leaders articulate clear expectations, yet they also encourage dialogue and invite multiple perspectives when developing policies or instructional strategies. Professional learning communities provide an effective structure for enacting transformational leadership. Within such communities, teachers engage in systematic inquiry into student learning, share instructional practices, and analyze assessment data. Leaders support these processes by providing time, resources, and encouragement. As professional trust grows, teachers demonstrate greater willingness to adopt innovative strategies and to assist colleagues in refining their practice. The result is a more cohesive and reflective institutional culture. Transformational leadership also emphasizes equity. Leaders identify and address barriers that may prevent some students from fully participating in learning. This may involve revising curriculum content, improving counseling services, or strengthening partnerships with families. By prioritizing inclusivity, leaders help ensure that educational success is not restricted to a privileged minority. In this way, transformational leadership contributes not only to improved academic performance but also to the broader social mission of education.

ਸੁਪਨੇ ਉਹੀ ਸੱਚ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਲਈ ਇਨਸਾਨ ਜਾਗ ਕੇ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉਦਾਹਰਨ: ਗਰੀਬ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਤੋਂ ਆਇਆ ਨੌਜਵਾਨ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਨਹੀਂ ਛੱਡਦਾ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣਾ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਬਦਲ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਫਲਤਾ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦਾ ਉਹ ਮਕਸਦ ਹੈ ਜਿਸਦੀ ਖੋਜ ਹਰ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਆਪਣੇ-ਆਪਣੇ ਢੰਗ ਨਾਲ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਅਸਲ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਕੋਈ ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਿਲਣ ਵਾਲੀ ਚੀਜ਼ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਬਲਕਿ ਇਹ ਸਾਲਾਂ ਦੀ ਲਗਾਤਾਰ ਮਿਹਨਤ, ਸਹੀ ਸੋਚ ਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਅਟੱਲ ਧੀਰਜ ਦਾ ਨਤੀਜਾ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਜੋ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਦੀ ਉਡੀਕ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਉਹ ਅਕਸਰ ਹਾਰ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਜੋ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਨਾਲ ਪਿਆਰ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਉਹ ਹੌਲੀ-ਹੌਲੀ ਆਪਣੀ ਮੰਜ਼ਿਲ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਜੋ ਹਰ ਰੋਜ਼ ਨਿਰੰਤਰ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਭਾਵੇਂ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਵਿੱਚ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ ਹੀ ਕਿਉਂ ਨਾ ਹੋਣ ਪਰ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਉਹੀ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੀ ਉੱਚੀ ਪੀੜੀ &apos;ਤੇ ਖੜਾ ਨਜ਼ਰ ਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੇ ਰਾਹ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਸਫਲਤਾ ਅਟੱਲ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਇਹ ਅਸਫਲਤਾ ਅੰਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਇੱਕ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਸਿਖਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਕਿੱਥੇ ਸੁਧਾਰ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਹੈ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇੱਕ ਵਪਾਰੀ ਜੋ ਪਹਿਲੇ ਕਾਰੋਬਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਸਹਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਹਾਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਮੰਨਦਾ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਤਜਰਬੇ ਨਾਲ ਦੂਜੇ ਯਤਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਾਮਯਾਬ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਸਫਲ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਅਤੇ ਆਮ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਅੰਤਰ ਇਹ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਕਿ ਇੱਕ ਕੋਲ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲਾਂ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦੀਆਂ ਬਲਕਿ ਅੰਤਰ ਇਹ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਸਫਲ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲਾਂ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ ਅੱਗੇ ਵਧਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇੱਕ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਜੋ ਘੱਟ ਸਾਧਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ ਵੀ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਬਿਹਤਰ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੇਣ ਲਈ ਨਵੇਂ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਲੱਭਦਾ ਹੈ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਸਿਖਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਜੋ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਸਮੇਂ ਨੂੰ ਵਿਅਰਥ ਗੁਜ਼ਾਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਉਹ ਮੌਕੇ ਗਵਾ ਬੈਠਦਾ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਜੋ ਸਮੇਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਹੀ ਢੰਗ ਨਾਲ ਵਰਤਦਾ ਹੈ ਉਹ ਛੋਟੇ ਪਲਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਵੀ ਵੱਡੀ ਉਪਲਬਧੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਦਲ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇੱਕ ਕਰਮਚਾਰੀ ਜੋ ਹਰ ਦਿਨ ਆਪਣੇ ਕੰਮ ਨੂੰ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਦੇ ਮੌਕੇ ਵਜੋਂ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਆਪਣੇ ਖੇਤਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਾਹਿਰ ਬਣ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜੋ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ &apos;ਤੇ ਭਰੋਸਾ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਉਹ ਅੱਧੀ ਮੰਜ਼ਿਲ ਤੈਅ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਮਾਂ ਸਬਰ ਅਤੇ ਸੱਚੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਦੇ ਵਿਅਰਥ ਨਹੀਂ ਜਾਂਦੇ। ਉਦਾਹਰਨ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਸਬਰ ਨਾਲ ਫਸਲ ਉਗਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦਾ ਫਲ ਮਿਲਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਸੰਸਕ੍ਰਿਤੀ ਆਪਣੀ ਰੰਗਤ, ਜੋਸ਼, ਮਿਠਾਸ ਅਤੇ ਉਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਲਈ ਸਾਰੀ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਵਿੱਚ ਪ੍ਰਸਿੱਧ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਸੰਸਕ੍ਰਿਤੀ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਜੀਵੰਤ ਅਤੇ ਰੂਹਾਨੀ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਇਸ ਦੇ ਲੋਕ ਨ੍ਰਿਤਿਆਂ ਗਿੱਧਾ ਅਤੇ ਭੰਗੜਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੱਸਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਦੋਵੇਂ ਨ੍ਰਿਤ ਭਾਵੇਂ ਵੱਖ-ਵੱਖ ਲਿੰਗਾਂ ਦੇ ਦੁਆਰਾ ਪ੍ਰਦਰਸ਼ਿਤ ਕੀਤੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਪਰ ਦੋਵੇਂ ਦੀ ਜੜ੍ਹ ਇੱਕੋ ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਅਤੇ ਇੱਕੋ ਮਿੱਠੇ ਲੋਕ-ਸੁਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਰਮੀ ਹੋਈ ਹੈ। ਗਿੱਧਾ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਪੰਜਾਬਣ ਦੀ ਸੁੰਦਰਤਾ, ਚੁਲਬਲੇਪਨ, ਰੰਗੀਨ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ, ਮਾਂ-ਭੈਣਾਂ ਦੇ ਰਿਸ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਮਿੱਠੀ ਡੋਰ ਅਤੇ ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਸਾਦੇ ਪਰ ਗੂੜੇ ਤਜਰਬਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਨਿਰਤ-ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੇਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਉੱਥੇ ਭੰਗੜਾ ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਮੁੰਡਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਹਿੰਮਤ, ਜੋਸ਼, ਮਰਦਾਨਗੀ ਖੇਤੀ-ਬਾੜੀ ਦੀ ਖੁਸ਼ਹਾਲੀ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਤਿਉਹਾਰੀ ਰੰਗਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਤਾਲਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੰਨ੍ਹ ਕੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੇ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਲਿਆਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਦੋਵੇਂ ਨ੍ਰਿਤ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਮਨੋਰੰਜਨ ਦੇ ਸਾਧਨ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਇਹ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਆਤਮਾ ਦੇ ਅੰਗ ਹਨ, ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਦੀਵੀ ਲੋਕ-ਬੁੱਧੀ, ਜੀਵਨ-ਦ੍ਰਿਸ਼ਟੀ ਅਤੇ ਰਵਾਇਤਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਪਰਛਾਵਾਂ ਹੁੰਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਗਿੱਧਾ, ਜੋ ਮੁੱਖ ਤੌਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਮਹਿਲਾਵਾਂ ਵੱਲੋਂ ਨੱਚਿਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਆਪਣੀ ਬਣਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਹੁਤ ਹੀ ਮਿਠਾਸ ਭਰਿਆ ਨ੍ਰਿਤ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਵਿਚ ਔਰਤਾਂ ਗੇੜ ਬਣਾਕੇ ਖੜ੍ਹਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਵਾਰੀ-ਵਾਰੀ &quot;ਬੋਲੀ&quot; ਪਾਉਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਬੋਲੀਆਂ ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਲੋਕ-ਕਵਿਤਾ ਦਾ ਸੋਹਣਾ ਰੂਪ ਹਨ, ਜਿਹਨਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਦੇ ਤਨਜ਼ ਕਦੇ ਪਿਆਰ, ਕਦੇ ਚੁਲਬਲਾਪਨ, ਕਦੇ ਦਰਦ, ਕਦੇ ਸਮਾਜਕ ਸੱਚਾਈਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਕਦੇ ਤਿਉਹਾਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਵਰਗੇ ਅਨਗਿਣਤ ਰੰਗ ਮਿਲਦੇ ਹਨ। ਗਿੱਧੇ ਦੀ ਹਰ ਬੋਲੀ ਇੱਕ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਦੱਸਦੀ ਹੈ—ਕਦੇ ਸੱਸ-ਨੂਹ ਦੀ, ਕਦੇ ਨਨਦ-ਭਾਬੀ ਦੀ, ਕਦੇ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਦੀ ਕਦੇ ਵਿਛੋੜੇ ਦੀ ਕਦੇ ਖੇਤੀ ਦੇ ਕੰਮਾਂ ਦੀ ਕਦੇ ਸਹੇਲੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਅਠੱਖੇਲਿਆਂ ਦੀ। ਗਿੱਧੇ ਦੀ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਖੂਬੀ ਇਹ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਿਸੇ ਨਿਰਧਾਰਿਤ ਸਟ੍ਰਕਚਰ ਦੀ ਬੰਨ੍ਹ ਨਹੀਂ ਹਰ ਔਰਤ ਆਪਣੀ ਕਲਾ, ਅਦਾ ਅਤੇ ਜਜਬੇ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਇਸ ਨ੍ਰਿਤ ਨੂੰ ਰੰਗੀਨ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਗਿੱਧੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਰਤੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹੱਥਾਂ ਦੇ ਹਾਵ-ਭਾਵ, ਤਾਲੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਰਿਥਮ, ਕਪੜਿਆਂ ਦੇ ਲਹਿਰਾਉਣ ਤੇ ਮੁੱਖੜਿਆਂ ਦੇ ਚਮਕਦੇ ਹਾਸੇ ਇਸ ਨ੍ਰਿਤ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਜੀਵੰਤ ਤਜਰਬਾ ਬਣਾ ਦੇਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਸਾਲਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਗਿੱਧਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਘਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਚੌਬਾਰੀਆਂ ਅੰਗਨਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਤਿਉਹਾਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਰਸਮ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਿਹਾ, ਸਗੋਂ ਹੁਣ ਇਹ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਭਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੰਜਾਬਣ ਦੀ ਪਹਚਾਣ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਔਰਤ ਦੀ ਬੋਲਣ ਦੀ ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ, ਆਪਣੇ ਜਜ਼ਬਾਤ ਨੂੰ ਬੇਧੜਕ ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਪ੍ਰਗਟ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਹਿੰਮਤ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਜਕ ਹਾਲਾਤਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਲੋਚਨਾਤਮਕ ਢੰਗ ਨਾਲ ਪ੍ਰਗਟਾਉਣ ਦੀ ਇੱਕ ਲੀਰੀਕਲ ਕਲਾ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ।

ਪ੍ਰੀਤੀ ਇੱਕ ਛੋਟੇ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੈਦਾ ਹੋਈ ਸੀ ਉਸਦਾ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਆਮਦਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਹੁਤ ਸੀਮਿਤ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਮਾਪੇ ਹਰ ਸਮੇਂ ਉਸਦੀ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਲਈ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਛੋਟੀ ਉਮਰ ਤੋਂ ਹੀ ਪ੍ਰੀਤੀ ਦੇ ਮਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੁਪਨੇ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਉਹ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੀ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਆਪਣੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਾਲ ਆਪਣਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਬਦਲੇ ਪਰ ਬਚਪਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਉਸਨੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਨੂੰ ਵਿਅਰਥ ਖ਼ਰਚ ਕੀਤਾ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਮੋਬਾਇਲ ਅਤੇ ਗੱਲਬਾਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਾਪੇ ਕਈ ਵਾਰੀ ਕਹਿੰਦੇ ਪੁੱਤਰੀ ਸਮਾਂ ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰੀ ਲੰਘ ਗਿਆ ਤਾਂ ਵਾਪਸ ਨਹੀਂ ਆਉਂਦਾ ਇਸਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਕਰ ਇਹ ਗੱਲ ਉਸਦੇ ਮਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਅਸਰ ਛੱਡ ਗਈ ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਉਹ ਪਿੰਡ ਦੇ ਘੜੀਸਾਜ਼ ਕੋਲ ਗਈ ਉਸਨੇ ਦੇਖਿਆ ਕਿ ਘੜੀਸਾਜ਼ ਹਰ ਪਲ ਨੂੰ ਧਿਆਨ ਨਾਲ ਮਾਪਦਾ ਅਤੇ ਘੜੀਆਂ ਠੀਕ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਉਸਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਹਰ ਪਲ ਦੀ ਕੀਮਤ ਹੈ ਜੇ ਇਸਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਕੀਤੀ ਤਾਂ ਬਹੁਤ ਕੁਝ ਖੋ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਇਹ ਗੱਲ ਪ੍ਰੀਤੀ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਚੇਤਾਵਨੀ ਬਣ ਗਈ ਉਸਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਦਿਨ ਦੀ ਯੋਜਨਾ ਬਣਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਹਰ ਘੰਟਾ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਘਰ ਦੇ ਕੰਮ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਬੀਜ਼ ਲਈ ਸਮਰਪਿਤ ਕੀਤਾ ਪਹਿਲੇ ਦਿਨ ਹੀ ਉਸਨੇ ਮਹਿਸੂਸ ਕੀਤਾ ਕਿ ਛੋਟੇ-ਛੋਟੇ ਪਲਾਂ ਦੀ ਕੀਮਤ ਕਰਕੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਕੁਝ ਹਾਸਿਲ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਸਹੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਨਾਲ ਪ੍ਰੀਤੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਫਲ ਹੋਈ ਉਸਨੇ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਯੋਗਿਤਾਵਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਭਾਗ ਲਿਆ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕੀਤੇ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਤਮਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਪਾਇਆ ਉਸਨੇ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਕਿ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਹੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਪ੍ਰਗਤੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਦੀ ਕੁੰਜੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਲੋਕ ਸਮੇਂ ਨੂੰ ਵਿਅਰਥ ਗੁਜ਼ਾਰਦੇ ਹਨ ਉਹ ਪਛਤਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਪਰ ਜੋ ਇਸਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਸੁਪਨਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਹਕੀਕਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਦਲ ਲੈਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਪ੍ਰੀਤੀ ਨੇ ਸਮਝ ਲਿਆ ਕਿ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਮਾਪ ਲੈਣਾ ਹੀ ਕਾਫ਼ ਨਹੀਂ ਬਲਕਿ ਇਸਦਾ ਸਹੀ ਇਸਤੇਮਾਲ ਕਰਨਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਕਲਾ ਹੈ। ਉਹ ਹਰ ਪਲ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਗਤੀ ਲਈ ਵਰਤਦੀ ਰਹੀ ਆਖ਼ਿਰਕਾਰ ਉਸਦੀ ਸਮੇਂ ਨਾਲ ਭਰਪੂਰ ਜੀਵਨ ਯਾਤਰਾ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਸਿਰਫ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਬਲਕਿ ਆਤਮਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਆਤਮ-ਅਨੁਭੂਤੀ ਵੀ ਦਿਵਾਈ। ਅਸੀਂ ਇਸ ਤੋਂ ਸਿਖਦੇ ਹਾਂ ਕਿ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਬੇਮੁੱਲ ਕਦਰ ਕਰਨੀ ਸਿਖੋ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਹਰ ਇੱਕ ਪਲ ਜੋ ਖਤਮ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ ਉਹ ਵਾਪਸ ਨਹੀਂ ਆਉਂਦਾ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਹੀ ਇੱਕ ਇਨਸਾਨ ਨੂੰ ਆਤਮ-ਸਫਲਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਪ੍ਰਗਤੀ ਦੇ ਰਸਤੇ ਤੇ ਲੈ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਇਸ ਲਈ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਕਰਨਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਅੱਛੀ ਆਦਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਬਲਕਿ ਇੱਕ ਜੀਵਨ ਬਦਲਣ ਵਾਲੀ ਯੋਜਨਾ ਹੈ।

ਪਾਣੀ ਧਰਤੀ ਉੱਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਮੂਲ ਅਤੇ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਤੱਤ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਦੇ ਬਗੈਰ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਪ੍ਰਕਾਰ ਦਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਸੰਭਵ ਨਹੀਂ। ਮਨੁੱਖ ਤੋਂ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਪਸ਼ੂ-ਪੱਖੀ, ਪੌਦੇ, ਮਿੱਟੀ, ਪਰਬਤ, ਹਵਾ ਅਤੇ ਪੂਰਾ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਣ— ਸਭ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਦਾ ਕੇਂਦਰ ਪਾਣੀ ਹੀ ਹੈ। ਧਰਤੀ ਦੀ ਸਤ੍ਹਾ ਦਾ ਲਗਭਗ ੭੧ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਸ਼ਤ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਪਾਣੀ ਨਾਲ ਢੱਕਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇਕ ਛੋਟਾ ਜਿਹਾ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਹੀ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਉਪਯੋਗ ਲਈ ਉਪਲਬਧ ਹੈ। ਬਾਕੀ ਸਭ ਪਾਣੀ ਸਮੁੰਦਰੀ ਖਾਰੇ ਝੀਲਾਂ, ਗਲੇਸ਼ੀਅਰਾਂ, ਬਰਫ਼ੀਲੇ ਪਹਾੜਾਂ ਜਾਂ ਅਜਿਹੀਆਂ ਥਾਵਾਂ &apos;ਤੇ ਬੰਦ ਹੈ, ਜਿੱਥੇ ਇਸਨੂੰ ਸਿੱਧੇ ਤੌਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਵਰਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਕਦੇ। ਹਾਲਾਂਕਿ ਪਾਣੀ ਬੇਹੱਦ ਮੁਫ਼ਤ ਅਤੇ ਕੁਦਰਤੀ ਸਰੋਤ ਵਾਂਗ ਦਿਖਾਈ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਅੱਜ ਮਨੁੱਖਤਾ ਇਸਦੀ ਘਾਟ, ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਅਤੇ ਅਸਮਾਨ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਦੀ ਵਜ੍ਹਾ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਕਟ ਦੇ ਮੁਹਾਨੇ &apos;ਤੇ ਖੜੀ ਹੈ। ਪਾਣੀ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਭੌਤਿਕ ਚੱਲਣ ਲਈ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਗੋਂ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਸੱਭਿਆਚਾਰ, ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ, ਉਦਯੋਗ, ਸਫ਼ਾਈ, ਸਿਹਤ ਅਤੇ ਧਾਰਮਿਕ ਰਸਮਾਂ ਦਾ ਵੀ ਅਟੁੱਟ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਹੈ। ਪੰਜਾਬ ਵਰਗੇ ਰਾਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਾਂ ਪਾਣੀ ਨੂੰ ਖੇਤੀ ਦੀ ਰੂਹ ਮੰਨਿਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਸਦੀਆਂ ਤੋਂ ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਸੱਭਿਆਚਾਰ ਦਾ ਅਧਾਰ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਪ੍ਰਚੂਰਤਾ &apos;ਤੇ ਟਿਕਿਆ ਹੈ। ਦਰੀਆ, ਨਹਿਰਾਂ, ਬਰਸਾਤਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਭੂਮਿਗਰਭੀ ਪਾਣੀ ਨੇ ਇਹ ਧਰਤੀ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਹਰੀ-ਭਰੀ ਰੱਖੀ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਲਾਪਰਵਾਹੀ, ਬੇਤਹਾਸ਼ਾ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਕਾਰਨ ਪਾਣੀ ਦਾ ਸੰਕਟ ਵੱਧਦਾ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ, ਜੋ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡਾ ਖਤਰਾ ਹੈ। ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਜੀਵ ਕੁਝ ਦਿਨਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹਿ ਸਕਦਾ। ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਸ਼ਰੀਰ ਦਾ ੬੦ ਤੋਂ ੭੦ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਸ਼ਤ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਪਾਣੀ ਤੋਂ ਬਣਿਆ ਹੈ, ਖ਼ੂਨ ਦਾ ਵੱਡਾ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਪਾਣੀ ਹੈ, ਦਿਮਾਗ਼ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਮਾਤਰਾ ਹੋਰ ਵੀ ਵੱਧ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਹਰ ਕੋਸ਼ ਦੀ ਕਾਰਗੁਜ਼ਾਰੀ ਪਾਣੀ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਸੰਭਵ ਹੈ। ਪਾਣੀ ਹੀ ਸਰੀਰ ਦੇ ਤਾਪਮਾਨ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਰੱਖਦਾ ਹੈ, ਖ਼ੂਨ ਦੀ ਗਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਨਿਯੰਤ੍ਰਿਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਖੁਰਾਕ ਨੂੰ ਪਚਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਗੰਦਗੀ ਨੂੰ ਬਾਹਰ ਕੱਢਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜੋੜਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਲੁਬ੍ਰਿਕੇਟ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਟਾਮਿਨ ਤੇ ਖਣਿਜਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਰੀਰ ਦੇ ਇੱਕ ਹਿੱਸੇ ਤੋਂ ਦੂਜੇ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਤੋਂ ਇਲਾਵਾ, ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਦਿਮਾਗ਼, ਗੁਰਦੇ ਅਤੇ ਜਿਗਰ ਦੀ ਕਾਰਗੁਜ਼ਾਰੀ ਵੀ ਪਾਣੀ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਠੀਕ ਰਹਿੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਲਈ ਹਰ ਉਮਰ ਦੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਲਈ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਪਰਯਾਪਤ ਮਾਤਰਾ ਲੈਣਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਲਾਜ਼ਮੀ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਅਫਸੋਸ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਅੱਜ ਸੰਸਾਰ ਦੇ ਕਈ ਖੇਤਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਾਫ਼ ਪੀਣਯੋਗ ਪਾਣੀ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਵੀ ਇੱਕ ਚੁਣੌਤੀ ਬਣ ਗਈ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਕਾਰਨ ਕਈ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਹੈਜ਼ਾ, ਟਾਈਫਾਇਡ, ਕਾਲਰਾ, ਡੇਂਗੂ ਅਤੇ ਗੰਦੇ ਪਾਣੀ ਨਾਲ ਪੈਦਾ ਹੋਣ ਵਾਲੀਆਂ ਹੋਰ ਮਹਾਂਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਫੈਲ ਰਹੀਆਂ ਹਨ।

“ਜੀਵਨ ਖੇਤਰ ਦੀ ਲੀਲ੍ਹਾ ਵੀ ਅਜਬ ਹੈ। ਸਤਿਗੁਰਾ ਇਸ ਨੂੰ ਛਿੰਜ ਦਾ ਅਖਾੜਾ ਕਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਗਿਆਨ ਦਾ ਮਾਇਆ ਨਾਲ, ਬੁਧ ਦਾ ਜੜ੍ਹਤਾ ਨਾਲ, ਉਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਦਾ ਭਰਮਾਦ ਨਾਲ, ਵਾਧੇ ਦਾ ਘਾਟੇ ਤੇ ਪੁੰਨ ਦਾ ਪਾਪ ਨਾਲ ਘੋਲ ਹੋ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ।” ਇਹਨਾਂ ਦੋਹਾਂ ਹੀ ਸੰਪਰਦਾਵਾਂ ਦੇ ਦੋ ਮੁਖੀ ਮਨੁੱਖਤਾ ਤੇ ਬਦੀ ਮੰਨੇ ਗਏ ਹਨ। ਮਨੁੱਖਤਾ ਉਤਾਂਹ ਉਠਣਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਬਦੀ ਰੋਕ ਪਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਹਰ ਬੀਜ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਫੁਟੇ ਅੰਕੁਰ ਨੂੰ, ਬੂਟਾ ਬਣਨ ਲਈ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਦੀ ਤਹਿ ਤੋੜ ਕੇ ਹੀ ਉਠਣਾ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਘੋਲ ਰਚਨਾ ਦੇ ਅਰੰਭ ਤੋਂ ਚਲਿਆ ਆ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਮਾਲਕ ਦੀ ਮਰਜ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਅਖਾੜਾ ਰਚਿਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਉਹ ਆਪ ਬੈਠਾ ਇਸ ਤਮਾਸ਼ੇ ਨੂੰ ਦੇਖ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਬਾਈਬਲ ਤੇ ਉਸ ਦੇ ਸਾਥੀ ਕੁਰਾਨ ਨੇ ਇਸ ਮੁਢਲੇ ਬਦੀ ਦੇ ਜਜ਼ਬੇ ਨੂੰ ਇਕ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਮੰਨਿਆ ਹੈ। ਖ਼ਿਆਲ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਪਹਿਲੇ ਮਨੁੱਖ, ਆਦਮ ਦੀ ਪੈਦਾਇਸ਼ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਫ਼ਰਿਸ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਮਖ਼ਲੂਕ ਮੌਜੂਦ ਸੀ। ਮਨੁੱਖ ਖ਼ਾਕ ਤੋਂ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਉਹ ਨੂਰ ਤੋਂ ਬਣਾਏ ਗਏ ਸਨ। ਉਹ ਹਰ ਵਕਤ ਖ਼ੁਦਾ ਦੀ ਬੰਦਗੀ ਵਿਚ ਲਗੇ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ। ਪਰ ਰੱਬ ਨੂੰ ਅਜਿਹੀ ਬੰਦਗੀ, ਜਿਸ ਦਾ ਬਦੀ ਨਾਲ ਕੋਈ ਵਾਹ ਹੀ ਨਾ ਪਵੇ, ਜੋ ਬੁਰਾਈ ਨਾਲ ਘੁਲ, ਉਸ ਨੂੰ ਪਛਾੜ, ਜਿਤ ਘਰ ਨਾ ਆਵੇ, ਕੁਝ ਪਸੰਦ ਨਾ ਆਈ। ਉਸਨੇ ਖ਼ਾਕੀ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਤੇ ਫ਼ਰਿਸ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਕਿਹਾ ਕਿ ਇਹਦੇ ਅਗੇ ਸਿਜਦਾ ਕਰੋ। ਉਹ ਰੱਬ ਦੀ ਆਗਿਆ ਮੰਨ ਸਿਜਦੇ ਵਿਚ ਡਿਗ ਪਏ, ਪਰ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਸ਼੍ਰੋਮਣੀ ‘ਅਜ਼ਾਜ਼ੀਲ’ ਨੇ ਇਸ ਹੁਕਮ ਦੇ ਵਿਰੁੱਧ ਰੋਸ ਪ੍ਰਗਟ ਕੀਤਾ ਕਿ ਅਸੀਂ ਨੂਰੀ ਹਾਂ, ਸਾਥੋਂ ਖ਼ਾਕੀ ਅਗੇ ਸਿਜਦਾ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਕਿਉਂ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ ਨੇ ਵੀ ਉਸ ਦਿਨ ਤੋਂ ਪ੍ਰਣ ਕਰ ਲਿਆ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਆਦਮ ਦੀ ਔਲਾਦ ਨੂੰ ਪਰਮੇਸ੍ਵਰ ਵਲੋਂ ਗੁਮਰਾਹ ਕਰੇਗਾ, ਉਸਨੂੰ ਨੇਕੀ ਵਲੋਂ ਹਟਾ ਬਦੀ ਵੱਲ ਜੋੜੇਗਾ ਤੇ ਸੁਰਗ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਕਢਾ ਦੋਜ਼ਖ਼ ਵਿਚ ਪਾ ਕੇ ਛੋੜੇਗਾ ਚੁਨਾਂਚਿ ਉਸ ਦਿਨ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ ਨੇ ਆਪਣਾ ਕੰਮ ਅਰੰਭ ਦਿੱਤਾ। ‘ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਹਵਾ ਨੂੰ ਭਰਮਾ, ਫਿਰ ਉਸਦੇ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਆਦਮ ਕੋਲੋਂ ਪਰਮੇਸ੍ਵਰ ਦੀ ਹੁਕਮ ਅਦੂਲੀ ਕਰਾਈ ਤੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਮਨ੍ਹਾ ਕੀਤੇ ਹੋਏ ਬੂਟੇ ਦਾ ਫਲ ਖਵਾ ਬਹਿਸ਼ਤ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਕਢਵਾਇਆ ਤੇ ਅੱਜ ਤਕ ਆਦਮ ਦੀ ਔਲਾਦ ਨੂੰ ਬਹਿਕਾਂਦਾ ਚਲਾ ਆ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ।’ ਯਵਨੀ ਮਤਾਂ ਦੇ ਇਸ ਅਕੀਦੇ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ, ਸੰਸਾਰ ਦੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਪੁਰਾਣੇ ਮਤ, ਪਾਰਸੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਵੀ ਇਸ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਲਦਾ ਜੁਲਦਾ ਖ਼ਿਆਲ ਹੈ। ‘ਯਸਦਾਨ’ ਤੇ ‘ਅਹਿਰਮਨ’। ਯਸਦਾਨ ਨੇਕੀ ਦੀ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਨਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਅਹਿਰਮਨ ਬਦੀ ਦੀ। ਇਹ ਦੋਵੇਂ ਨੇਕੀ ਤੇ ਬਦੀ ਦੇ ਦੇਵਤੇ ਪਹਿਲੇ ਦਿਨ ਤੋਂ ਬਰਾਬਰ ਹੀ ਤੁਰੇ ਆਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਥੇ ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ ਕੋਈ ਪਰਮੇਸ੍ਵਰ ਦੇ ਅਧੀਨ ਤੇ ਉਸਦਾ ਸਰਾਪਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਫ਼ਰਿਸ਼ਤਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ, ਸਗੋਂ ਬਰਾਬਰ ਦੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਯਸਦਾਨ ਦੇ ਬਰਾਬਰ ਹੀ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਬਦੀ ਵਲ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਨਾ ਕਰ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ।

ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦਾ ਉਹ ਅਧਾਰ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਕਲਪਨਾ ਕਰਨੀ ਵੀ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲ ਹੈ। ਧਰਤੀ ਤੇ ਮੌਜੂਦ ਹਵਾ, ਪਾਣੀ, ਮਿੱਟੀ, ਦਰੱਖ਼ਤ, ਪਹਾੜ, ਨਦੀਆਂ, ਸਮੁੰਦਰ, ਜੰਗਲ, ਜੀਵ-ਜੰਤੂ, ਸੂਰਜ ਦੀ ਰੌਸ਼ਨੀ, ਤਾਪਮਾਨ, ਮੌਸਮ ਅਤੇ ਉਹ ਸਭ ਕੁਝ ਜੋ ਸਾਡੇ ਆਲੇ-ਦੁਆਲੇ ਹੈ ਮਿਲ ਕੇ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਪ੍ਰਕ੍ਰਿਤੀ ਦਾ ਹੀ ਤੋਹਫ਼ਾ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸੱਗੋਂ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਤਰੱਕੀ ਦਾ ਅਸਲ ਸਰੋਤ ਵੀ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਅੱਜ ਜਿਹੜਾ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਅਸੀਂ ਵਰਤ ਰਹੇ ਹਾਂ, ਉਸ ਦੀ ਸਥਿਤੀ ਬੜੀ ਤੇਜ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਬਿਗੜ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ। ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਲਾਲਚ, ਬੇਤਹਾਸਾ ਉਦਯੋਗੀਕਰਨ, ਜੰਗਲਾਂ ਦੀ ਅੰਨ੍ਹੀ ਕੱਟਾਈ, ਵਧਦੀ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ, ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ, ਰਸਾਇਣਕ ਖਾਦਾਂ ਦਾ ਵਰਤੋਂ, ਪਲਾਸਟਿਕ ਦਾ ਜ਼ਹਿਰ, ਵਾਹਨਾਂ ਦਾ ਧੂੰਆ, ਕਾਰਖ਼ਾਨਿਆਂ ਦਾ ਕਚਰਾ, ਨਦੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਗੰਦਗੀ ਨਾਲ ਭਰ ਜਾਣ ਨੇ ਪ੍ਰਕ੍ਰਿਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਗੰਭੀਰ ਖ਼ਤਰੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਅੱਜ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਬਚਾਉਣਾ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਲਈ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰੀ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਜੇ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਬਚੇਗਾ ਤਾਂ ਹੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਬਚੇਗਾ। ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਅਸੀਂ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਜੰਗਲਾਂ ਦੀ ਅਹਿਮੀਅਤ ਸਮਝਣੀ ਪਵੇਗੀ। ਦਰੱਖ਼ਤ ਧਰਤੀ ਦੇ ਸੱਚੇ ਰੱਖਵਾਲੇ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਆਕਸੀਜਨ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਮੌਸਮ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਰੱਖਦੇ ਹਨ, ਪੰਛੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਜੰਗਲੀ ਪ੍ਰਾਣੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਠਿਕਾਣਾ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਮਿੱਟੀ ਨੂੰ ਕਟਾਅ ਤੋਂ ਬਚਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਕਾਰਬਨ ਡਾਈਆਕਸਾਈਡ ਜਿਹੇ ਗੈਸਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਜੜ੍ਹਾਂ ਤੇ ਪੱਤਿਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਮਾ ਕੇ ਧਰਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਗਰਮ ਹੋਣ ਤੋਂ ਬਚਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਪਰ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਲਾਲਚ ਨੇ ਦਰੱਖ਼ਤਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਵਪਾਰਕ ਸਾਮਾਨ ਬਣਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਵਧਦੇ ਸ਼ਹਿਰ, ਹਾਈਵੇ, ਪੁਲ, ਕਾਲੋਨੀਆਂ, ਫੈਕਟਰੀਆਂ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਜੰਗਲਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਤੇਜ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਕੱਟਿਆ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਜੰਗਲ ਕੱਟਣ ਨਾਲ ਬਾਰਿਸ਼ ਦੇ ਪੈਟਰਨ ਬਦਲ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ, ਮਿੱਟੀ ਬੰਝਰ ਹੋ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ, ਨਦੀਆਂ ਸੁੱਕ ਰਹੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਜੰਗਲੀ ਜੀਵਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਪ੍ਰਜਾਤੀਆਂ ਲੁਪਤ ਹੁੰਦੀਆਂ ਜਾ ਰਹੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਜਦੋ ਜੰਗਲ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ ਤਾਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦਾ ਮੌਸਮ ਅਤੇ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਨ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਵੀ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਲਈ ਦੁਬਾਰਾ ਜੰਗਲ ਲਗਾਉਣ, ਟ੍ਰੀ ਪਲਾਂਟੇਸ਼ਨ ਮੁਹਿੰਮਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾ-ਤੋਂ-ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾ ਹਰੇ-ਭਰੇ ਖੇਤਰ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਹੈ। ਪਾਣੀ ਨੂੰ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਨਦੀ ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਅੱਜ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੇ ਸਰੋਤ ਤੇਜ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਘੱਟ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ। ਭੂਗਰਭ ਪਾਣੀ ਬੇਤਹਾਸਾ ਖਿੱਚਣ ਕਾਰਨ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਚਲਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ।

ਸਾਡੇ ਸਮਾਜ ਦੀ ਸ਼ਕਤੀ, ਉਸਦੀ ਖੁਸ਼ਹਾਲੀ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਦੀ ਪਛਾਣ ਉਸਦੀ ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਨਿਹਿਤ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਕਿਸੇ ਇੱਕ ਚੀਜ਼ ਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਨਹੀਂ, ਬਲਕਿ ਇਹ ਭਾਸ਼ਾ, ਸੰਸਕਾਰ, ਰਸਮੋ-ਰਿਵਾਜ਼, ਲੋਕ-ਧਾਰਮ, ਕਲਾਵਾਂ, ਸੰਗੀਤ, ਪਹਿਰਾਵੇ, ਇਮਾਰਤਾਂ, ਖਾਣੇ ਅਤੇ ਇਤਿਹਾਸਕ ਤਜ਼ਰਬਿਆਂ ਦਾ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਸ਼ਾਲ ਭੰਡਾਰ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਦੁਨੀਆ ਭਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਲੋਕ ਆਪਣੇ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਨੂੰ ਜਿਉਂਦਾ ਰੱਖਣ ਲਈ ਵੱਖ-ਵੱਖ ਪ੍ਰੋਗਰਾਮ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਰੋਹ ਮਨਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਸਮਾਰੋਹਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ, ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਮੇਲਾ ਇੱਕ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਮੰਚ ਹੈ, ਜੋ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ, ਅਧਿਆਪਕਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਜ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਜੜਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਜੋੜਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਮੇਲਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦਾ, ਬਲਕਿ ਇਹ ਨਵੀਂ ਪੀੜ੍ਹੀ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਇਤਿਹਾਸਕ ਅਤੇ ਸੱਭਿਆਚਾਰਕ ਪਛਾਣ ਨਾਲ ਗਹਿਰਾਈ ਨਾਲ ਜੋੜਨ ਦਾ ਇੱਕ ਅਨਮੋਲ ਮੌਕਾ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਮੇਲੇ ਦੀ ਖ਼ਾਸ ਗੱਲ ਇਹ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਲੈਣ ਵਾਲਾ ਹਰੇਕ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਕਿਸੇ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਸ਼ੇ ਨੂੰ ਚੁਣ ਕੇ ਉਸ ਬਾਰੇ ਖੋਜ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਇਕੱਠੀ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਰਚਨਾਤਮਕ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਨਾਲ ਪੇਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਵਿਸ਼ਾ ਇਤਿਹਾਸਕ ਘਟਨਾ, ਮਹਾਨ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ, ਪੁਰਾਤਤਵ ਸਥਲ, ਰਵਾਇਤੀ ਖੇਡ, ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਸੱਭਿਆਚਾਰ ਦਾ ਕੋਈ ਖ਼ਾਸ ਪੱਖ, ਲੋਕ ਕਲਾ, ਲੋਕ ਧਾਰਮ, ਭਾਂਡ-ਭਾਂਡ; ਰਵਾਇਤੀ ਹਥਕਲਾਵਾਂ, ਜਾਂ ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਲੜੀਵਾਰ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਦੇ ਅਨੇਕਾਂ ਪੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਹੋ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਇਲਾਕੇ, ਧਰਮ, ਜਾਂ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਬੰਧਿਤ ਵੀ ਕੋਈ ਵਿਸ਼ਾ ਚੁਣ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ, ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਉਹ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸਮਾਜਕ ਪੱਧਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ, ਬਲਕਿ ਆਪਣੇ ਨਿੱਜੀ ਪੱਧਰ ਤੇ ਵੀ ਆਪਣੀਆਂ ਜੜਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਜਾਣ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ। ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਮੇਲੇ ਦੀ ਤਿਆਰੀ ਇੱਕ ਲੰਬੀ ਅਤੇ ਰੁਚਿਕਰ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਵਿਸ਼ੇ ਦੀ ਚੋਣ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਫਿਰ ਉਸ ਸਬੰਧੀ ਕਿਤਾਬਾਂ, ਅਖ਼ਬਾਰਾਂ, ਇੰਟਰਨੈੱਟ, ਵੱਡੇ-ਬਜ਼ੁਰਗਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਕਥਾਵਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਸਰੋਤਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਇਕੱਠੀ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਖੋਜ ਯੋਗਤਾ [ਰਿਸਰਚ ਸਕਿਲਜ਼] ਨੂੰ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰਦੀ, ਬਲਕਿ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਧੀਰਜ, ਨਿਗਰਾਨੀ, ਅਤੇ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਨੂੰ ਠੀਕ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਨਾਲ ਇਕੱਠਾ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਕਲਾ ਵੀ ਵਿਕਸਤ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਉਸ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ, ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਪ੍ਰੋਜੈਕਟ ਲਈ ਚਾਰਟ, ਮਾਡਲ, ਪੋਸਟਰ, ਤਸਵੀਰਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਛੋਟੀਆਂ ਹੱਥ-ਤਿਆਰ ਕਲਾਕਾਰੀਆਂ ਵੀ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਸ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਹਾਥਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲਾ ਤਰੀਕਾ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਕਲਾ-ਕੌਸ਼ਲ ਅਤੇ ਸੋਚਣ ਦੀ ਯੋਗਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਵਧਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਮੇਲੇ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਪੱਖ ਹੈ ਪੇਸ਼ਕਾਰੀ। ਜਦੋਂ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਪ੍ਰੋਜੈਕਟ ਨੂੰ ਅਧਿਆਪਕਾਂ, ਜੱਜਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਰੱਖਦੇ ਹਨ, ਤਾਂ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੀ ਗੱਲ ਨੂੰ ਸਪੱਸ਼ਟ, ਤਰਤੀਬਬੰਦ ਅਤੇ ਆਤਮਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ

ਸਿਹਤ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਕੀਮਤੀ ਖਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਰਫ਼ਤਾਰ, ਤਰੱਕੀ, ਖੁਸ਼ੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਜਕ ਸਦਭਾਵਨਾ ਸਭ ਕੁਝ ਬੇਮਾਇਨ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਿਹਤ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਬਿਮਾਰੀ-ਰਹਿਤ ਹੋਣ ਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸੱਗੋਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਸ਼ਾਰੀਰਕ, ਮਾਨਸਿਕ, ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਅਤੇ ਭਾਵਨਾਤਮਕ ਸੁਖ-ਸ਼ਾਂਤੀ ਦੇ ਪੂਰੇ ਮਿਲਾਪ ਨੂੰ ਸਿਹਤ ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇੱਕ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਸਿਹਤਮੰਦ ਤਦ ਹੀ ਮੰਨਿਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਦੋਂ ਉਸਦਾ ਸਰੀਰ ਤੰਦਰੁਸਤ, ਦਿਮਾਗ ਸ਼ਾਂਤ, ਮਨ ਖੁਸ਼, ਆਚਰਨ ਸਾਫ਼ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਸ਼ੈਲੀ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਹੋਵੇ। ਸਿਹਤ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਲਈ ਪਰਮਾਤਮਾ ਦੀ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਦਾਤ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਅਕਸਰ ਲੋਕ ਇਸ ਦਾਤ ਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਉਸ ਵੇਲੇ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ ਜਦੋਂ ਸਿਹਤ ਹੱਥੋਂ ਨਿਕਲ ਜਾਣ ਲੱਗਦੀ ਹੈ। ਅਜੋਕੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਰੱਕੀ, ਟੈਕਨੋਲੋਜੀ ਅਤੇ ਵੱਧਦੀ ਦੌੜ-ਭੱਜ ਨੇ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਤੋਂ ਸਿਹਤ ਦੀਆਂ ਮੁੱਲਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਕਿਸੇ ਹੱਦ ਤੱਕ ਦੂਰ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਤੇਜ਼ ਰਫ਼ਤਾਰ ਵਾਲੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ, ਗਲਤ ਖੁਰਾਕ, ਤਣਾਵ, ਮੋਟਾਪਾ, ਮਾਨਸਿਕ ਦਬਾਅ, ਘੱਟ ਸ਼ਰੀਰਕ ਕਸਰਤ, ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ, ਨਸ਼ਿਆਂ, ਦਵਾਈਆਂ ਦੀ ਬੇਤਹਾਸਾ ਵਰਤੋਂ, ਸਕਰੀਨ ਦਾ ਵੱਧ ਸਮਾਂ— ਕੁਝ ਸਿਹਤ ਦੇ ਵਿਰੋਧੀ ਬਣਦੇ ਜਾ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ। ਸਿਹਤ ਪ੍ਰਤੀ ਲਾਪਰਵਾਹੀ ਦੇ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਅੱਜ ਸਮਾਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੱਧ ਰਹੇ ਰੋਗਾਂ, ਬੇਮਾਰੀਆਂ, ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨਕ ਤਣਾਵ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਘਟ ਰਹੇ ਗੁਣਵੱਤਾ ਪੱਧਰ ਦੇ ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਨਜ਼ਰ ਆ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ। ਇਸ ਲਈ ਸਿਹਤ ਦੇ ਹਰ ਪਹਲੂ ਨੂੰ ਡੂੰਘਾਈ ਨਾਲ ਸਮਝਣਾ, ਇਸ ਦੀ ਰੱਖਿਆ ਕਰਨੀ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਬਣਾਉਣਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੈ। ਸ਼ਰੀਰਕ ਸਿਹਤ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਸਿਹਤ ਦਾ ਮੁੱਖ ਆਧਾਰ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਰੀਰ ਦੀ ਤਾਕਤ, ਉਰਜਾ, ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਤੋਂ ਬਚਾਅ, ਪਚਾਉ ਪ੍ਰਣਾਲੀ, ਦਿਲ, ਦਿਮਾਗ, ਜਿਗਰ, ਗੁਰਦੇ, ਰਗਾਂ, ਹੱਡੀਆਂ, ਮਾਸਪੇਸ਼ੀਆਂ ਕੁਝ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਸ਼ਾਰੀਰਕ ਸਿਹਤ ਲਈ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਤੱਤ ਹੈ ਖੁਰਾਕ। ਖੁਰਾਕ ਦਾ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਸਰੀਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਵੱਡਾ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਅੱਜ ਦੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਫਾਸਟ ਫੂਡ, ਤਲੀਆਂ ਹੋਈਆਂ ਚੀਜ਼ਾਂ, ਬਾਜ਼ਾਰ ਦੇ ਖਾਣੇ, ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾ ਚਰਬੀ, ਸ਼ੂਗਰ, ਨਮਕ ਤੇ ਕੈਮੀਕਲ ਵਾਲੇ ਖਾਣੇ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਬਹੁਤ ਵਧ ਗਈ ਹੈ, ਜੋ ਅਨੇਕਾਂ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਮੁੱਖ ਕਾਰਨ ਬਣ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ। ਮੋਟਾਪਾ, ਸ਼ੂਗਰ, ਦਿਲ ਦੇ ਰੋਗ, ਕੋਲੇਸਟ੍ਰੋਲ, ਬਲੱਡ ਪ੍ਰੈਸ਼ਰ ਗਲਤ ਖੁਰਾਕ ਦੇ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਹਨ। ਦੂਜੇ ਪਾਸੇ, ਸਿਹਤਮੰਦ ਖੁਰਾਕ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਤਾਜ਼ੇ ਫਲ, ਹਰੇ ਸਬਜ਼ੀਆਂ, ਦਾਲਾਂ, ਅੰਨ, ਸੁਕੇ ਮੇਵੇ, ਦੂਧ, ਦਹੀਂ, ਪਾਣੀ ਅਤੇ ਘਰ ਦਾ ਸਧਾਰਨ ਭੋਜਨ—ਸਰੀਰ ਨੂੰ ਤੰਦਰੁਸਤ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਖਾਣੇ ਦਾ ਸਹੀ ਸਮੇਂ ਤੇ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਮਾਤਰਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੇਵਨ ਸਿਹਤ ਲਈ ਬਹੁਤ ਲਾਭਕਾਰੀ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਪ੍ਰਾਚੀਨ ਤੇ ਅਟੁੱਟ ਜ਼ਰੂਰਤ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਮਾਤਰ ਇੱਕ ਆਰਥਿਕ ਗਤੀਵਿਧੀ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਗੋਂ ਸੱਭਿਆਚਾਰ, ਪਰੰਪਰਾਵਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਚੱਕਰ ਦਾ ਅਹੰਮ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਹੈ। &quot;ਖੇਤੀ&quot; ਦਾ ਮਤਲਬ ਹੈ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੀਜ ਬੀਜਣਾ, ਉਸ ਦੀ ਸੰਭਾਲ ਕਰਨੀ ਅਤੇ ਅੰਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੈਦਾਵਾਰ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਨੀ। &quot;ਬਾੜੀ&quot; ਦਾ ਅਰਥ ਹੈ ਇਸ ਪੈਦਾਵਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਕਾਸ। ਭਾਰਤ ਅਤੇ ਖ਼ਾਸ ਕਰਕੇ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਵਿੱਚ ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਸਦੀਓਂ ਤੋਂ ਮੁੱਖ ਆਧਾਰ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਰੋਟੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਸਾਧਨ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਗੋਂ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਦੀ ਆਤਮ-ਗੌਰਵ ਦੀ ਪਛਾਣ ਵੀ ਹੈ। ਖੇਤੀ ਨਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਭੋਜਨ ਦਾ ਸਰੋਤ ਹੈ, ਸਗੋਂ ਰੋਜ਼ਗਾਰ, ਉਦਯੋਗ ਅਤੇ ਨਿਰਯਾਤ ਦਾ ਆਧਾਰ ਵੀ ਹੈ। ਪ੍ਰਾਚੀਨ ਕਾਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਜੰਗਲਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਰਹਿ ਕੇ ਫਲ, ਜੜੀਆਂ ਤੇ ਸ਼ਿਕਾਰ ਕਰਕੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਜੀਉਂਦੇ ਸਨ। ਪਰ ਜਦੋਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੇ ਨਦੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਕੰਢੇ ਵਸਣਾ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕੀਤਾ, ਉਸਨੇ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਅਤੇ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਕੇ ਬੀਜ ਬੀਜਣੇ ਸਿੱਖੇ। ਭਾਰਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੰਡਸ ਘਾਟੀ ਸਭਿਆਚਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਦੇ ਨਿਸ਼ਾਨ ਮਿਲਦੇ ਹਨ। ਧਾਨ, ਜਵ, ਕਣਕ ਆਦਿ ਦੀ ਖੇਤੀ ਹਜ਼ਾਰਾਂ ਸਾਲ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਹੋ ਰਹੀ ਸੀ। ਪੰਜਾਬ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਦਾ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਲੰਮਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਰਾਜ ਸਭਿਆਚਾਰ, ਜੀਵਨਸ਼ੈਲੀ ਅਤੇ ਮਾਨਸਿਕਤਾ ਦਾ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ। ਪੰਜਾਬ, ਜਿਸਨੂੰ &quot;ਭਾਰਤ ਦਾ ਅਨਾਜ ਘਰ&quot; ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਖੇਤੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਲੰਬੀ ਛਾਲ ਮਾਰੀ। 1960 ਦੇ ਦਹਾਕੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਈ &quot;ਹਰੀ ਕ੍ਰਾਂਤੀ&quot; ਨੇ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਖੇਤੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਕ੍ਰਾਂਤੀਕਾਰੀ ਬਦਲਾਵ ਲਿਆ। ਨਵੀਆਂ ਤਕਨੀਕਾਂ, ਰਸਾਇਣਕ ਖਾਦਾਂ, ਕੀਟਨਾਸ਼ਕ, ਤੇ ਹਾਈ-ਯੀਲਡ ਬੀਜਾਂ ਦੇ ਕਾਰਨ ਧਾਨ ਤੇ ਕਣਕ ਦੀ ਉਤਪਾਦਕਤਾ ਕਈ ਗੁਣਾ ਵਧੀ। ਪਰ ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਵਿਧੀਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਲੰਬੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਲਈ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵ ਨਕਾਰਾਤਮਕ ਵੀ ਹੋਏ। ਮਿੱਟੀ ਦੀ ਉਪਜਾਊ ਸਮਰਥਾ ਘਟਣ ਲੱਗੀ, ਪਾਣੀ ਦਾ ਪੱਧਰ ਲੰਮੇ ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਥੱਲੇ ਚਲਾ ਗਿਆ, ਤੇ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਰਸਾਇਣਾਂ &apos;ਤੇ ਨਿਰਭਰ ਹੋਣ ਲੱਗੇ। ਭਵਿੱਖ ਦੀ ਖੇਤੀ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਉਤਪਾਦਨ &apos;ਤੇ ਆਧਾਰਿਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹੇਗੀ, ਸਗੋਂ ਮਿੱਟੀ, ਪਾਣੀ, ਜੈਵ ਵਿਭਿੰਨਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਈਕੋ-ਸਿਸਟਮ ਦੀ ਸੁਰੱਖਿਆ ਵੀ ਲਾਜ਼ਮੀ ਹੋਵੇਗੀ। ਜੈਵਿਕ ਖੇਤੀ, ਡਿਜ਼ੀਟਲ ਫਾਰਮਿੰਗ, ਮਲਟੀ-ਕ੍ਰਾਪਿੰਗ, ਏਗ੍ਰੋ-ਫੋਰੇਸਟਰੀ, ਅਤੇ ਡਾਇਵਰਸਿਫਾਇਡ ਫਾਰਮਿੰਗ ਵਰਗੀਆਂ ਵਿਧੀਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਨਵਾਂ ਰਸਤਾ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਜਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਪੱਤਰਕਾਰਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਖਾਸ ਤੌਰ ’ਤੇ ਸੱਦਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਆ ਕੇ ਆਪਣੀਆਂ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਨਾਲ਼ ਦੇਖਣ ਕਿ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਪ੍ਰਤੀ ਹਮਾਇਤ ਕਿੰਨੀ ਮਜਬੂਤ ਹੈ। ਸ਼ਾਇਦ ਉਹ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਯਕੀਨ ਦਿਵਾਉਣਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੇ ਸਨ ਕਿ ਉਸ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਦੀਆਂ ਵਧੀਕੀਆਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਜੋ ਕੁੱਝ ਲਿਖਿਆ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ, ਉਹ ਸਭ ਝੂਠ ਸੀ, ਉੱਥੇ ਕਿਸੇ ’ਤੇ ‘ਤਸ਼ੱਦਦ’ ਨਹੀਂ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ, ਘੇਰਾਬੰਦੀ ਪੂਰੀ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਹਟਾ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਗਈ ਸੀ ਸੂਬੇ ਦੇ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਹਿੱਸੇ ’ਚ ਦਹਿਸ਼ਤਗਰਦ ਜਾਂ ਅਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਦੀ ਲੜਾਈ ਵਰਗੀ ਕੋਈ ਮੁਹਿੰਮ ਨਹੀਂ ਬਚੀ ਸੀ। ਸੱਦੇ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਅਸੀਂ ਸ਼ਹਿਰ ਦੀ ਓਪੇਰਾ ਬਿਲਡਿੰਗ ਦੇ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਇਕੱਠੇ ਹੋਣਾ ਸੀ। ਉੱਥੇ ਇੱਕ ਮਿੱਠ-ਬੋਲੜੇ ਅਫਸਰ ਨੇ ਸਾਡਾ ਸਵਾਗਤ ਕੀਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਸਰਕਾਰੀ ਬੱਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਿਠਾ ਲਿਆ। ਬੱਸ ਦੇ ਅੰਦਰ ਮੱਧਮ ਸੰਗੀਤ ਵੱਜ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ। ਜਦੋਂ ਬੱਸ ਰਵਾਨਾ/ ਹੋਈ, ਅਫਸਰ ਨੇ ਕਲਿੱਪ ’ਤੇ ਲੱਗਿਆ ਮਾਈਕ੍ਰੋਫੋਨ ਕੱਢਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਨਿਮਰਤਾ ਨਾਲ਼ ਸਾਡਾ ਦੁਬਾਰਾ ਸਵਾਗਤ ਕੀਤਾ। ਮੇਰਾ ਨਾਮ ਗਾਰੇਕ ਹੈ!” ਉਸਨੇ ਕੁੱਝ ਝਿਜਕਦੇ ਹੋਏ ਕਿਹਾ, “ਇਸ ਸਫਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੈਂ ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਮਾਰਗਦਰਸ਼ਕ ਹਾਂ!” ਥੋੜ੍ਹਾ ਅੱਗੇ ਤੁਰ ਕੇ ਉਸ ਨੇ ਹੱਥ ਦੇ ਇਸ਼ਾਰੇ ਨਾਲ਼ ਉਹ ਥਾਂ ਦਿਖਾਈ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਆਦਰਸ਼ ਹਾਊਸਿੰਗ ਕਲੋਨੀ ਦੀ ਨੀਂਹ ਰੱਖੀ ਜਾਣੀ ਸੀ। ਸ਼ਹਿਰ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਹਰ ਨਿੱਕਲ਼ਦੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਅਸੀਂ ਇੱਕ ਸੁੱਕੀ ਨਦੀ ਦੇ ਪੁਲ ਨੂੰ ਪਾਰ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਇੱਕ ਜਵਾਨ ਸਿਪਾਹੀ ਹੱਥ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ # ਲਾਈਟ ਮਸ਼ੀਨਗੰਨ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਲਾਪਰਵਾਹੀ ਨਾਲ਼ ਖੜ੍ਹਾ ਸੀ। ਸਾਨੂੰ ਦੇਖ ਕੇ ਉਸ ਨੇ ਗਰਮਜੋਸ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ਼ ਹਵਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੱਥ ਲਹਿਰਾਇਆ। ਗਾਰੇਕ ਨੇ ਦੱਸਿਆ– ਕਿ ਇਸ ਖੇਤਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਨਿਸ਼ਾਨੇਬਾਜੀ ਦੀ ਸਿਖਲਾਈ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਵਿੰਗੇ+ਟੇਢੇ ਰਸਤਿਆਂ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਉੱਪਰ ਚੜ੍ਹਦੇ ਹੋਏ ਅਸੀਂ ਗਰਮ ਅਤੇ ਸੁੱਕੇ ਮੈਦਾਨ ’ਚ ਨਿੱਕਲ਼ ਆਏ। ਖਿੜਕੀ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਆਉਂਦੀ ਚਾਕ ਵਰਗੀ ਬਰੀਕ ਧੂੜ ਕਾਰਨ ਸਾਡੀਆਂ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਸੜਨ ਲੱਗੀਆਂ। ਗਰਮੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਅਸੀਂ ਆਪਣਾ ਕੋਟ ਲਾਹ ਲਿਆ, ਪਰ ਗਾਰੇਕ ਨੇ ਆਪਣਾ ਕੋਟ ਪਾਈ ਰੱਖਿਆ। ਹੱਥ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਾਈਕ੍ਰੋਫੋਨ ਫੜੀ, ਉਹ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਬੇਜਾਨ, ਬੰਜਰ ਮੈਦਾਨਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੈਦਾਵਾਰ ਵਧਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਸਰਕਾਰੀ ਯੋਜਨਾਵਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਦੱਸ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ। ਮੇਰੇ ਕੋਲ਼ ਬੈਠੇ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਨੇ ਕੁੱਝ ਅਕੇਵੇਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਪਣਾ ਸਿਰ ਪਿੱਛੇ ਕਰ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਬੰਦ ਕਰ ਲਈਆਂ ਸਨ ਮੈਂ ਉਸ ਨੂੰ ਕੂਹਣੀ ਮਾਰਕੇ ਜਗਾਉਣ ਬਾਰੇ ਸੋਚਿਆ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਬੱਸ ਦੇ ‘ਰੀਅਰ ਵਿਊ’ ਸ਼ੀਸ਼ੇ ’ਚੋਂ ਦਿਖਾਈ ਦੇਣ ਵਾਲ਼ੀਆਂ ਗਾਰੇਕ ਦੀਆਂ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਮੁੜ-ਮੁੜ ਸਾਡੇ ਦੋਵਾਂ ’ਤੇ ਰੁਕ ਰਹੀਆਂ ਸਨ। ਫਿਰ ਗਾਰੇਕ ਆਪਣੀ ਸੀਟ ਤੋਂ ਉੱਠਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਮੁਸਕਰਾਉਂਦੇ ਚਿਹਰੇ ਨਾਲ਼ ਸਾਰੇ ਮਹਿਮਾਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਪਰਾਲ਼ੀ ਦੀਆਂ ਟੋਪੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਕੋਲਡ ਡਰਿੰਕਸ ਦੀਆਂ ਠੰਡੀਆਂ ਬੋਤਲਾਂ ਦੇ ਕੇ ਸੀਟਾਂ ਦੀ ਤੰਗ ਗਲ਼ੀ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਲੰਘਿਆ।

ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਉਹ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਨੀਂਹ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ &apos;ਤੇ ਪੂਰਾ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਖੜ੍ਹਾ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਕਿਤਾਬੀ ਗਿਆਨ ਤੱਕ ਸੀਮਿਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹਿੰਦੀ ਬਲਕਿ ਇਹ ਸੋਚਣ ਦੀ ਸਮਰਥਾ, ਸਹੀ ਫੈਸਲੇ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਸਮਝ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਨੂੰ ਬਿਹਤਰ ਢੰਗ ਨਾਲ ਜੀਣ ਦੀ ਕਲਾ ਸਿਖਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ; ਇੱਕ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਨਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਆਪਣੇ ਲਈ ਸਗੋਂ ਸਮਾਜ ਲਈ ਵੀ ਲਾਭਦਾਇਕ ਸਾਬਤ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਹ ਅਗਿਆਨਤਾ ਦੀ ਥਾਂ ਤਰਕ, ਹਨੇਰੇ ਦੀ ਥਾਂ ਰੋਸ਼ਨੀ ਅਤੇ ਡਰ ਦੀ ਥਾਂ ਆਤਮ-ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਨੂੰ ਚੁਣਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇੱਕ ਪੜ੍ਹਿਆ-ਲਿਖਿਆ ਨੌਜਵਾਨ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲ ਹਾਲਾਤਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਘਬਰਾਉਂਦਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਹੱਲ ਲੱਭਣ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ; ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਇਨਸਾਨ ਨੂੰ ਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ ਸਿਖਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਨਿਯਮਤ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ, ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਪਾਬੰਦੀ ਅਤੇ ਲਕਸ਼ ਪ੍ਰਤੀ ਵਚਨਬੱਧਤਾ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਜੋ ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਸਮਾਂ-ਸਾਰਣੀ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਪੜ੍ਹਦਾ ਹੈ ਉਹੀ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਪਣੇ ਕੰਮ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਢੰਗ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਭਾਲ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ; ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡਾ ਲਾਭ ਇਹ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਸਹੀ ਅਤੇ ਗਲਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਅੰਤਰ ਸਮਝਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਪੜ੍ਹਿਆ-ਲਿਖਿਆ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਅੰਧ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਫਸਣ ਦੀ ਬਜਾਏ ਤਰਕ ਨਾਲ ਸੋਚਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਸਿਹਤ, ਸਮਾਜਕ ਰਿਵਾਜਾਂ ਜਾਂ ਕਾਨੂੰਨ ਸੰਬੰਧੀ ਮਸਲਿਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਉਹ ਅਫ਼ਵਾਹਾਂ ਦੀ ਥਾਂ ਗਿਆਨ &apos;ਤੇ ਭਰੋਸਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ; ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਗਰੀਬੀ ਦੂਰ ਕਰਨ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਹਥਿਆਰ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇੱਕ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਹੁਨਰਾਂ ਦੇ ਆਧਾਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਰੋਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਹਾਸਲ ਕਰ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਆਉਣ ਵਾਲੀ ਪੀੜ੍ਹੀ ਦਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਵੀ ਸੁਧਾਰ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇੱਕ ਆਮ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਤੋਂ ਆਇਆ ਬੱਚਾ ਜਦੋਂ ਪੜ੍ਹ ਲਿਖ ਕੇ ਚੰਗੀ ਨੌਕਰੀ ਹਾਸਲ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਪੂਰੇ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਦੀ ਸਥਿਤੀ ਬਦਲ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ; ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਨਾਰੀ ਸਸ਼ਕਤੀਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਕੁੰਜੀ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਜਦੋਂ ਇੱਕ ਲੜਕੀ ਪੜ੍ਹਦੀ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਸਿਰਫ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਪੂਰਾ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਜ ਅੱਗੇ ਵਧਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਪੜ੍ਹੀ-ਲਿਖੀ ਮਾਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਬੱਚਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਚੰਗੀਆਂ ਮੁੱਲਾਂ, ਸਿਹਤ ਅਤੇ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਤੀ ਸਚੇਤ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ; ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਯੁੱਗ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੀ ਮਹੱਤਤਾ ਹੋਰ ਵੀ ਵਧ ਗਈ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ, ਵਿਗਿਆਨ ਅਤੇ ਡਿਜ਼ੀਟਲ ਹੁਨਰਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਅੱਗੇ ਵਧਣਾ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕੰਪਿਊਟਰ ਗਿਆਨ ਅਤੇ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਸਕਿੱਲਾਂ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਵਾਲਾ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਰੋਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਦੇ ਵੱਧ ਮੌਕੇ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ;

ਸੋਸ਼ਲ ਮੀਡੀਆ ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਯੁੱਗ ਦੀ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਸ਼ਾਲੀ ਅਤੇ ਤੇਜ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਕਰ ਰਹੀ ਤਕਨੀਕੀ ਕੜੀ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਨੇ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਹਰ ਖੇਤਰ ਨੂੰ ਬੇਹੱਦ ਬਦਲ ਕੇ ਰੱਖ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਜਿਹੜਾ ਕਿਰਦਾਰ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਟੈਲੀਵਿਜ਼ਨ, ਰੇਡੀਓ, ਅਖ਼ਬਾਰ ਜਾਂ ਰਵਾਇਤੀ ਸੰਚਾਰ ਮਾਧਿਮ ਨਿਭਾਉਂਦੇ ਸਨ, ਉਹ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵ ਅੱਜ ਸੋਸ਼ਲ ਮੀਡੀਆ ਨੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੈਦਾ ਕੀਤਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਜਗਤ ਦੇ ਇੱਕ ਕੋਨੇ ਦੀ ਘਟਨਾ ਦੂਜੇ ਕੋਨੇ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚਣ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੁਝ ਮਿੰਟ ਵੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਲੱਗਦੇ। ਫੇਸਬੁੱਕ, ਇੰਸਟਾਗ੍ਰਾਮ, ਯੂਟਿਊਬ, ਵਟਸਐਪ, ਟਵਿੱਟਰ (ਐਕਸ), ਸਨੈਪਚੈਟ, ਟੈਲੀਗ੍ਰਾਮ, ਲਿੰਕਡਇਨ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਅਨੇਕ ਪਲੇਟਫ਼ਾਰਮਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਮਾਜ ਦੀ ਸੋਚ, ਰਵੱਈਏ, ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਦੀਆਂ ਆਦਤਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਰਿਸ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਨਵੀਂ ਪ੍ਰਵਿਰਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਜਨਮ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਅੱਜ ਦੇ ਨੌਜਵਾਨ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਸੋਸ਼ਲ ਮੀਡੀਆ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਅਧੂਰੀ ਜਾਪਦੀ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਹ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਮਨੋਰੰਜਨ ਦਾ ਸਰੋਤ ਹੈ, ਸਗੋਂ ਗਿਆਨ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤੀ, ਖ਼ਬਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਤਾਜ਼ਗੀ, ਕਾਰੋਬਾਰ ਦੀ ਤਰੱਕੀ, ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਜਾਗਰੂਕਤਾ, ਰਾਜਨੀਤਿਕ ਗਤੀਵਿਧੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਨਿੱਜੀ ਪਛਾਣ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਦਾ ਵੀ ਸਾਧਨ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕਿਆ ਹੈ। ਸੋਸ਼ਲ ਮੀਡੀਆ ਨੇ ਸੰਚਾਰ ਦੇ ਢੰਗ ਨੂੰ ਬਿਲਕੁਲ ਬਦਲ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਇੱਕ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਜਾਂ ਸੁਨੇਹਾ ਪਹੁੰਚਣ ਵਿੱਚ ਦਿਨ ਲੱਗ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਸਨ, ਅੱਜ ਇੱਕ ਕਲਿਕ ਨਾਲ ਪੂਰੀ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਨਾਲ ਗੱਲਬਾਤ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾ ਸਕਦੀ ਹੈ। ਵੀਡੀਓ ਕਾਲਾਂ ਨੇ ਵਿਦੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਜਦੂਰੀ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲਿਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਪਰਿਵਾਰਾਂ ਦੇ ਦਰਮਿਆਨ ਦੀ ਦੂਰੀ ਨੂੰ ਕਾਫ਼ੀ ਘੱਟ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਸਹੂਲਤਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਇਕ ਦੂਜੀ ਸੱਚਾਈ ਵੀ ਜੁੜੀ ਹੋਈ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਸੋਸ਼ਲ ਮੀਡੀਆ ਨੇ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਹੌਲੀ-ਹੌਲੀ ਵਰਚੁਅਲ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੈਦ ਕਰਨਾ ਵੀ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਲੋਕ ਮਿੱਠੇ ਰਿਸ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਭਾਲਣ ਲਈ ਮਿਲਦੇ, ਗੱਲਬਾਤ ਕਰਦੇ, ਇਕੱਠੇ ਤਿਉਹਾਰ ਮਨਾਉਂਦੇ, ਹੁਣ ਬਹੁਤੇ ਲੋਕ ਫ਼ੋਨ ਦੀ ਸਕਰੀਨ &apos;ਤੇ ਹੀ ਇਹ ਸਭ ਕੁਝ ਦੇਖਣ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਖਾਉਣ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਤੁਸ਼ਟ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਹਕੀਕਤ ਅਤੇ ਫਰਜ਼ੀ ਚਮਕ ਦੇ ਵਿਚਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਲਕੀਰ ਪਤਲੀ ਹੋ ਗਈ ਹੈ। ਲੋਕ ਅਸਲ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਨਾਲੋਂ ਸੋਸ਼ਲ ਮੀਡੀਆ &apos;ਤੇ ਆਪਣਾ ਚਿੱਤਰ ਹੋਰ ਵੀ ਚਮਕਦਾਰ ਅਤੇ ਸੁਧਾਰਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਦਿਖਾਉਣ ਦੀ ਹੋੜ ਵਿੱਚ ਲੱਗੇ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਸ ਕਾਰਨ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਨੌਜਵਾਨਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੀਨ-ਭਾਵਨਾ, ਤਣਾਅ, ਡਿਪ੍ਰੈਸ਼ਨ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਦਬਾਅ ਵਧਣ ਲੱਗ ਪਿਆ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਹ ਦੂਜਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਪੋਸਟਾਂ, ਤਸਵੀਰਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਵੀਡੀਓਜ਼ ਨਾਲ ਆਪਣੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਦੀ ਤੁਲਨਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਖੁਦ ਨੂੰ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਘੱਟ ਸਮਝਣ ਲੱਗ ਪੈਂਦੇ ਹਨ।

ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਦੇਸ਼, ਰਾਜ ਜਾਂ ਖੇਤਰ ਦੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ, ਆਰਥਿਕ, ਸਿੱਖਿਆਈ, ਰਾਜਨੀਤਿਕ ਅਤੇ ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣਕ ਤਰੱਕੀ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਤੱਤ ਹੈ। ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਧਣਾ ਜਾਂ ਘਟਣਾ ਦੋਵੇਂ ਹੀ ਸਮਾਜ ਲਈ ਮਹੱਤਵ ਦੇ ਵਿਸ਼ੇ ਹਨ। ਅੱਜ ਦੀ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਨਾਲ ਜੁੜੀਆਂ ਸਮੱਸਿਆਵਾਂ ਤੇ ਮੌਕੇ ਦੋਵੇਂ ਹੀ ਮੌਜੂਦ ਹਨ। ਦੁਨੀਆ ਦੀ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ੮ ਅਰਬ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਹੋ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਅਗਲੇ # ਵਰ੍ਹਿਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਹ ਹੋਰ ਵਧਣ ਦੀ ਸੰਭਾਵਨਾ ਹੈ। ਭਾਰਤ, ਜੋ ਹੁਣ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਾਲਾ ਦੇਸ਼ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕਾ ਹੈ, ਇੱਥੇ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਦੀ ਤੀਬਰ ਵਾਧ ਦਰ ਨੇ ਆਰਥਿਕ ਤਰੱਕੀ, ਨੌਕਰੀਆਂ, ਸਿੱਖਿਆ, ਸਿਹਤ, ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ ਅਤੇ ਸਰੋਤਾਂ &apos;ਤੇ ਬੇਹੱਦ ਦਬਾਅ ਪਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਧਣ ਦੇ ਕਾਰਣਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਮਝਣ ਲਈ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਹਾਲਾਤਾਂ, ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੋਚ, ਆਰਥਿਕ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤੀ, ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੀ ਕਮੀ, ਸਿਹਤ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੁਧਾਰ ਅਤੇ ਮੌਤ ਦਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਘਟਾਅ ਜਿਹੇ ਤੱਤ ਵੇਖਣੇ ਪੈਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਪੁਰਾਣੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੌਤ ਦਰ ਬਹੁਤ ਵੱਧ ਸੀ, ਬੱਚਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਬਚਾਅ ਦਰ ਘੱਟ ਸੀ, ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਇਲਾਜ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ, ਇਸ ਲਈ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਵੱਡੇ ਰੱਖੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਸਨ। ਪਰ ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਦੌਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੈਡੀਕਲ ਸੁਵਿਧਾਵਾਂ ਦੇ ਵਧਣ ਨਾਲ ਮੌਤ ਦਰ ਘਟ ਗਈ ਅਤੇ ਜਨਮ ਦਰ ਉੱਚੀ ਰਹਿਣ ਕਰਕੇ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਧਦੀ ਗਈ। ਨਾਲ ਹੀ, ਕਈ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਸੋਚਾਂ, ਖ਼ਾਸਕਰ ਪੁੱਤਰ ਪਸੰਦ, ਵੀ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਾਧ &apos;ਚ ਯੋਗਦਾਨ ਪਾਉਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਪੇਂਡੂ ਖੇਤਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੀ ਕਮੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਛੋਟੇ ਰੱਖਣ ਬਾਰੇ ਜਾਗਰੂਕਤਾ ਵੀ ਘੱਟ ਹੈ। ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਧਣ ਨਾਲ ਬਹੁਤ ਸਾਰੀਆਂ ਸਮੱਸਿਆਵਾਂ ਜੁੜੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲੀ ਸਮੱਸਿਆ ਹੈ ਸਰੋਤਾਂ ਦੀ ਘਾਟ। ਧਰਤੀ ਦੇ ਪਾਣੀ, ਭੋਜਨ, ਜ਼ਮੀਨ, ਉਰਜਾ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਸਰੋਤ ਸੀਮਤ ਹਨ। ਜਦ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਧਦੀ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਇਹਨਾਂ ਸਰੋਤਾਂ &apos;ਤੇ ਦਬਾਅ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸ਼ਹਿਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਕਮੀ, ਮਹਿੰਗਾਈ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਾਧਾ, ਜਲ-ਸੰਕਟ, ਟ੍ਰੈਫ਼ਿਕ ਜਾਮ, ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਜ਼ਾਫ਼ਾ—  ਇਹ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਾਧ ਦੇ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਹਨ। ਘਰਾਂ ਲਈ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਘੱਟ ਪੈ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਕਾਰਨ ਬੇਘਰੇਪਣ, ਗਰੀਬੀ ਅਤੇ ਝੱਗੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਫੈਲਾਅ ਵੱਧ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਦੀ ਵਧਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਕਾਰਨ ਖੇਤੀ ਬਾਘਲਾ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਖਾਦ ਉਤਪਾਦਨ ਵਧਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਰਸਾਇਣਕ ਖਾਦਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਕੀਟਨਾਸ਼ਕਾਂ ਦਾ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਦੀ ਸਿਹਤ ਖਰਾਬ ਹੋ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ। ਨਵਿਆਂ ਘਰਾਂ, ਫੈਕਟਰੀਆਂ ਤੇ ਸੜਕਾਂ ਲਈ ਜੰਗਲ ਕੱਟਣੇ ਪੈਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ &apos;ਤੇ ਬੁਰਾ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਧਣ ਕਾਰਨ ਨਦੀਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਲ-ਮੂਤਰ, ਉਦਯੋਗਿਕ ਕਚਰਾ ਅਤੇ ਗੰਦਗੀ ਪੈਣ ਲੱਗਦੀ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਪਾਣੀ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਿਤ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਾਫ਼ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਕਮੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਫੈਲਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਸਿਹਤ ਪ੍ਰਣਾਲੀ &apos;ਤੇ ਵਾਧੂ ਦਬਾਅ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਮੇਰੇ ਸੱਕੂਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਖਾਸ ਦਿਨ ਮਨਾਇਆ ਗਿਆ ਸੀ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਜਦੋਂ ਸੱਕੂਲ ਨੂੰ ਹਾਫ ਡੇਅ ਦਾ ਐਲਾਨ ਕੀਤਾ ਗਿਆ। ਮੇਰੇ ਲਈ ਇਹ ਦਿਨ ਇੱਕ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਦੇ ਐਤਿਹਾਸਿਕ ਯਾਦਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ। ਇਹ ਨਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਮੇਰੇ ਲਈ, ਸਗੋਂ ਮੇਰੇ ਸਾਰੇ ਦੋਸਤਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਸੱਕੂਲ ਦੇ ਬੱਚਿਆਂ ਲਈ ਖਾਸ ਸੀ। ਸੱਚ ਪੁੱਛੋ ਤਾਂ, ਮੈਂ ਇਸ ਦਿਨ ਦਾ ਸਬੂਤ ਪਿਛਲੇ ਕੁਝ ਸਾਲਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਨਹੀਂ ਭੁੱਲਿਆ। ਸੱਕੂਲ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਜੁੜੀ ਹਰ ਇੱਕ ਯਾਦ ਨੂੰ ਦਿਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਕੜ ਕੇ ਰੱਖਦਾ ਹਾਂ, ਪਰ ਇਸ ਦਿਨ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਕੁਝ ਵੱਖਰੀ ਸੀ। ਇਹ ਦਿਨ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਆਮ ਦਿਨ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ, ਇਹ ਇੱਕ ਖਾਸ ਦਿਨ ਸੀ ਜਿਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਿੱਖਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ-ਨਾਲ ਖੁਸ਼ੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਮਜ਼ੇ ਦਾ ਵੀ ਤੜਕਾ ਸੀ। ਹਾਫ ਡੇਅ ਸੱਕੂਲ ਦਾ ਐਲਾਨ ਇੱਕ ਸੋਮਵਾਰ ਦੀ ਸਵੇਰੇ ਹੋਇਆ। ਅਸੀਂ ਸਵੇਰੇ ਸੱਕੂਲ ਆਏ ਤਾਂ ਗੁਣਗੁਣਾਹਟ ਦਾ ਮਾਹੌਲ ਸੀ। ਅਜਿਹਾ ਲੱਗ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੁਝ ਵਿਸ਼ੇਸ਼ ਹੋਣ ਵਾਲਾ ਹੈ। ਸਿੱਖਿਆਦਾਰ ਅਤੇ ਅਧਿਆਪਕਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲ ਅਤੇ ਪੂਰਨ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਵਾਲੀਆਂ ਕਲਾਸਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕੋਈ ਰੁਚੀ ਦੀ ਘਾਟ ਹੋ ਜਾਏ, ਤਾ ਇਹ ਆਧਿਕ ਭਾਵਨਾਵਾਂ ਦੀ ਦੁਨੀਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਾਧਾ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਿਵੇਂ ਹੀ ਅਸੀਂ ਕਲਾਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਹੁੰਚੇ, ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਜੀ ਨੇ ਇਸ ਖਾਸ ਦਿਨ ਬਾਰੇ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਦੱਸਿਆ। ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੱਸਿਆ ਕਿ ਅੱਜ ਸੱਖਣੀ ਮੌਜੂਦਾ ਹਾਲਾਤ ਅਤੇ ਯੋਜਨਾ ਨੂੰ ਧਿਆਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਰੱਖਦੇ ਹੋਏ, ਸੱਕੂਲ ਨੂੰ ਹਾਫ ਡੇਅ ਦੇ ਤੌਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਮਨਾਇਆ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਇਸ ਦਿਨ ਦਾ ਉਦੇਸ਼ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਮਨੋਰੰਜਨ ਦੇ ਵਿਚਕਾਰ ਇਕ ਅਹੰਕਾਰ ਵਾਲਾ ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਬਣਾਉਣਾ ਸੀ, ਤਾਂ ਜੋ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲੇ ਬੱਚੇ ਵੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਦਿਨ ਦਾ ਅਨੰਦ ਮਾਣ ਸਕਣ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਮਾਹੌਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੁਝ ਖ਼ਾਸ ਕਰ ਸਕਣ। ਪਹਿਲੀ ਪੜਾਈ ਦਾ ਸੈਸ਼ਨ ਖਤਮ ਹੋਇਆ, ਫਿਰ ਸਾਡੇ ਅਧਿਆਪਕਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਲਈ ਬੁਲਾਇਆ। ਖੇਡਾਂ ਦੇ ਕਿਰਦਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਸੀਂ ਇੱਕ ਦੂਜੇ ਨਾਲ ਮੁਕਾਬਲਾ ਕਰਨ ਜਾ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ। ਸਾਥ ਹੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਚਿਹਰੇ &apos;ਤੇ ਹੰਸੀਆਂ ਵੀ ਬਣ ਰਹੀਆਂ ਸਨ। ਇਸ ਦਿਨ ਦੇ ਦੌਰਾਨ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਹਰ ਕੋਈ ਆਪਣੀ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਖ਼ੁਦ ਨੂੰ ਲੁੱਟ ਰਹਾ ਸੀ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਇਹ ਦਿਨ ਸਭ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਦੀ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਪ੍ਰਗਟ ਹੋ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ। ਬੱਚੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਦੋਸਤਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਗੋਲੀ ਫੈਕਟਰੀ ਵਿਚ ਲਗੇ ਅਤੇ ਖੇਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਧੇਰੇ ਬੇਹਤਰੀਨ ਦਰਜਿਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੰਮ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ। ਤੁਰੰਤ, ਸਕੂਲ ਦੇ ਅਧਿਆਪਕਾਂ ਨੇ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡਾ ਖੇਡ ਮੁਕਾਬਲਾ ਅਯੋਜਿਤ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਿਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਾਰੇ ਬੱਚੇ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੋਏ। ਜਿਥੇ ਹਰ ਇੱਕ ਦੋਸਤ ਆਪਣੀ ਖੇਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੁਝ ਵੱਖਰੀ ਜਿੰਦਗੀ ਦਿਖਾਉਂਦਾ ਸੀ, ਸਾਰੇ ਬੱਚੇ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਉਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਅਤੇ ਮਨੋਰੰਜਨ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਖੇਡ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ। ਜਦੋਂ ਅਸੀਂ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਮੁਕੰਮਲ ਕੀਤਾ, ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਜੀ ਨੇ ਅਸੀਂ ਸਭ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਛੋਟਾ ਜਿਹਾ ਤੋਹਫਾ ਦੇਣ ਦੀ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਿੱਤੀ।

ਕੁਕਰਮੀ ਮਨੁਖਾਂ ਦੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਬਾਰੇ ਬਾਬਾ ਫਰੀਦ ਜੀ ਕਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ ਕਿ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਪਾਹ ਵੇਲਣੇ ਵਿਚ ਵੇਲੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਤਿਲ ਆਦਿਕ ਕੋਹਲੂ ਵਿਚ ਪੀੜੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਹਾਂਡੀ ਅੱਗ ਤੇ ਪਈ ਤਪਦੀ ਹੈ, ਤਿਵੇਂ ਵਿਕਾਰੀ ਮਨੁਖਾਂ ਦਾ ਸਾਰਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੁਖਾਂ ਦੀ ਇਕ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ; ਆਪ ਫੁਰਮਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ: ਫਰੀਦਾ ਵੇਖੁ ਕਪਾਹੈ ਜਿ ਥੀਆ, ਕਿ ਸਿਰਿ ਬੀਆ ਤਿਲਾਹ, ਕਮਾਦੇ ਅਰੁ ਕਾਗਦੇ, ਕੁੰਨੇ ਕੋਇਲਿਆਹ-ਮੰਦੇ ਅਮਲ ਕਰੇਂਦਿਆਂ, ਏਹ ਸਜਾਇ ਤਿਨਾਹ-ਨਿਡਰ ਹੋ ਕੇ ਵਿਕਾਰਾਂ ਵਿਚ ਪ੍ਰਵਿਰਤ ਹੋਣ ਵਾਲੇ ਬੰਦਿਆਂ ਦਾ ਹਾਲ ਸਾਹਿਬ ੴ ਗੁਰੂ ਅੰਗਦ ਦੇਵ ਜੀ ਦਸਦੇ ਹੋਏ ਫੁਰਮਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਵਿਕਾਰਾਂ ਵਲ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਨ ਵਾਲੇ ਮਨ ਨੂੰ &apos;ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ&apos; ਦਸ ਕੇ ਕੁਰਾਨ ਸ਼ਰੀਫ ਵਿਚ ਮਨੁਖ ਨੂੰ ਖਬਰਦਾਰ ਕੀਤਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ: &apos;ਲਾ ਤੱਤਾ ਬਿ-ਊ ਖੁਤੁਵਾਤਿੱਸ਼ੈਤਾਨਿ&apos; ਭਾਵ, ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ ਦੇ ਪੂਰਨਿਆਂ ਤੇ ਨਾਹ ਤੁਰੋ। ਸਮੇਂ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਦੇਸ ਦੀ ਬੋਲੀ ਵਿਚ ਹਰੇਕ &apos;ਧਰਮ&apos; ਨੇ ਮਨੁਖ ਨੂੰ ਪਾਪ ਕਰਨ ਵਲੋਂ ਵਰਜਿਆ ਹੈ। ‘ਜੇ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਹਰ ਵੇਲੇ ਪਾਪਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਡਰਦਾ ਤੇ ਕੰਬਦਾ ਰਹੇ’, ਅਤੇ ਇਹੀ ਸੋਚਦਾ ਰਹੇ ਕਿ ਮਤਾਂ ਫਲਾਣੇ ਮੰਦ ਕਰਮ ਵਿਚ ਕਿਤੇ ਫਸ ਨਾ ਜਾਵਾਂ, ਤਾਂ ਇਸ ਦਾ ਸਿੱਟਾ ਸਗੋਂ ਉਲਟਾ ਨਿਕਲਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਨ ਢਹਿੰਦੀ ਕਲਾ ਵਿਚ ਚਲਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਨੁਖ ਪਾਪ ਦਾ ਟਾਕਰਾ ਕਰਨ ਤੋਂ ਅਸਮਰਥ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਹਦੋਂ ਵਧੀ ਹੋਈ ਘਬਰਾਹਟ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਮਨ ਨੂੰ ਭਲਾਈ ਵਲ ਪ੍ਰੇਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਕਦੀ। ਸ੍ਰੀ ਚਮਕੌਰ ਸਾਹਿਬ ਦੇ ਜੁਧ ਪਿਛੇ ਜਦੋਂ ਕਲਗੀਧਰ ਪਾਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਮਾਛੂਵਾੜੇ ਮਸੰਦ ਦੇ ਘਰ ਅੱਪੜੇ, ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਤਾਂ ਉਸ ਨੇ ਆਦਰ ਭਾਉ ਕੀਤਾ, ਪਰ ਜਦੋਂ ਉਸ ਨੂੰ ਇਹ ਪਤਾ ਲਗਾ ਕਿ ਸਰਹੰਦ ਦੇ ਸੂਬੇ ਦੀ ਫੌਜ ਸਤਿਗੁਰੂ ਜੀ ਦੀ ਭਾਲ ਵਿਚ ਚੜ੍ਹੀ ਹੋਈ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਉਹ ਬੜਾ ਘਬਰਾਇਆ। ਮੁਗਲ ਰਾਜ ਦੇ ਡਰ ਹੇਠ ਉਹ ਇਤਨਾ ਦਬ ਗਿਆ ਕਿ ਜਿਉਂ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਕਲਗੀਧਰ ਜੀ ਉਸ ਨੂੰ ਦਲੇਰ ਹੋਣ ਲਈ ਮੱਤ ਦੇਂਦੇ ਗਏ, ਉਹ ਮੁਗਲਾਂ ਦੇ ਤੇਜ਼-ਪ੍ਰਤਾਪ ਦਾ ਹਊਆ ਅਖਾਂ ਅਗੇ ਲਿਆ ਲਿਆ ਕੇ ਹੋਰ ਨਿੱਘਰਦਾ ਗਿਆ। ਸੰਨ ੧੬੮੭ ਵਿਚ ਜਦੋਂ ਪਹਾੜੀ ਰਾਜਿਆਂ ਨੇ ਕਹਲੂਰ ਦੇ ਰਾਜੇ ਦੀ ਮਦਦ ਤੇ ਅਕਾਰਨ ਹੀ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਉਤੇ ਰਿਆਸਤ ਨਾਹਨ ਵਿਚ ਆਇਆਂ ਤੇ ਹੱਲਾ ਬੋਲ ਦਿਤਾ ਸੀ, ਉਹਨੀਂ ਦਿਨੀਂ ਹੇਹਰਾਂ ਦਾ ਮਹੰਤ ਕ੍ਰਿਪਾਲ ਦਾਸ ਭੀ ਹਜ਼ੂਰ ਦੇ ਪਾਸ ਸੀ। ਇਹ ਭੀ ਉਸ ਜੁਧ ਵਿਚ ਆਪਣਾ &apos;ਕੁਤਕ&apos; ਲੈ ਕੇ ਹੀ ਨਿਰਭੈ ਜੋਧਿਆਂ ਵਾਂਗ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੋਇਆ।

ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦਾ ਅਹੰਕਾਰਪੂਰਕ ਸਥਾਨ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਉਹੀ ਮਾਧਿਅਮ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਲਕੜੇ ਨੂੰ ਪੂਰਾ ਕਰ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੇ ਬਿਨਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਅਧੂਰਾ ਅਤੇ ਨਿਸ਼ਪ੍ਰਭ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਫਲਤਾ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿਅਕਤੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਪੈਰ ਚੁੰਮਦੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਆਦਤ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦਾ ਅਰਥ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸ਼ਰੀਰਕ ਕੰਮ ਨਹੀਂ, ਬਲਕਿ ਮਾਨਸਿਕ ਲਗਨ, ਸਮਰਪਣ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ ਭਰੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਵੀ ਹੈ। ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਗਵਾਹ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਜਿਹੜੇ ਲੋਕ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਧਰਮ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਉਹੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੇ ਸ਼ਿਖਰ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚਦੇ ਹਨ। ਮਿਸਾਲ ਵਜੋਂ ਅਮਰੀਕਾ ਦੇ ਰਾਸ਼ਟਰਪਤੀ ਅਬਰਾਹਮ ਲਿੰਕਨ, ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਗਰੀਬੀ, ਅਸਮਰਥਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਪਰੀਤ ਹਾਲਾਤਾਂ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ ਆਪਣੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਸਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਪਣਾ ਨਾਮ ਬਣਾਇਆ। ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨੇ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਕਿ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ਾਂ ਦੇ ਰਾਹ ਤੋਂ ਗੁਜ਼ਰ ਕੇ ਹੀ ਮਨਜ਼ਿਲ ਮਿਲਦੀ ਹੈ। ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਵਧੀਆ ਨੌਕਰੀ, ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਵਧੀਆ ਅੰਕ, ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੈਡਲ ਅਤੇ ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਨਾਮ ਤੇ ਇੱਜ਼ਤ। ਪਰ ਇਹ ਸਾਰੀਆਂ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤੀਆਂ ਇੱਕ ਹੀ ਆਧਾਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਨਿਰਭਰ ਕਰਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ – ਅਤੇ ਉਹ ਹੈ ਮਿਹਨਤ। ਇਕ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਜੋ ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਇਮਤਿਹਾਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਚੰਗੇ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਲਿਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਖਿਡਾਰੀ ਜੋ ਦਿਨ-ਰਾਤ ਅਭਿਆਸ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਓਹੀ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਮੈਡਲ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਵਿਗਿਆਨੀ ਜੋ ਰਾਤਾਂ ਜਾਗ ਕੇ ਤਜਰਬੇ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਉਹੀ ਨਵੀਂ ਖੋਜ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਥੋਮਸ ਐਡਿਸਨ ਨੇ ਲਾਈਟ ਬਲਬ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਹਜ਼ਾਰ ਵਾਰ ਅਸਫਲਤਾ ਸਹੀ ਪਰ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਛੱਡੀ, ਜੋ ਅੱਜ ਚਾਨਣ ਬਣੀ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਨਾ ਅਸਾਨ ਨਹੀਂ, ਇਹ ਇੱਕ ਅਭਿਆਸ, ਆਦਤ ਅਤੇ ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨਿਕ ਤਿਆਰੀ ਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਸਮੇਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਇੰਟਰਨੈਟ, ਆਰਟੀਫੀਸ਼ੀਅਲ ਇੰਟੈਲੀਜੈਂਸ ਅਤੇ ਨਵੀਂ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ ਆ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ, ਉਥੇ ਵੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਘੱਟ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੋਈ। ਹੁਣ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੇ ਰੂਪ ਬਦਲੇ ਹਨ – ਪਰ ਮਤਲਬ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਅਜੇ ਵੀ “ਲਗਨ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼” ਹੀ ਹੈ। ਆਨਲਾਈਨ ਕੰਮ, ਕੋਡਿੰਗ, ਡਿਜ਼ਾਈਨ, ਡਿਜੀਟਲ ਮਾਰਕੇਟਿੰਗ ਆਦਿ ਨਵੇਂ ਖੇਤਰ ਹਨ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਚੁਣੌਤੀਆਂ ਆਉਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ – ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਨਿਭਣ ਲਈ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਗਿਆਨ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਖ਼ਤ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਵੀ ਚਾਹੀਦੀ ਹੈ। ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਤੌਰ ਤੇ ਵੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੀ ਮਹੱਤਤਾ ਘੱਟ ਨਹੀਂ।

ਇੱਕ ਮਾਸਟਰ ਜੋ ਮਨ ਲਾ ਕੇ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਉਹ ਕਈ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਬਦਲ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇੱਕ ਡਾਕਟਰ ਜੋ ਦਿਨ-ਰਾਤ ਮਰੀਜ਼ਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੇਵਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਉਹ ਸਚਮੁਚ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੇ ਉੱਚੇ ਦਰਜੇ &apos;ਤੇ ਖੜਾ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਗੁਰੂ ਨਾਨਕ ਦੇਵ ਜੀ ਨੇ ਵੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਾਲ ਕਮਾਈ ਗੁਜਾਰਨ ਦੀ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਿੱਤੀ। ਉਹ ਕਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ – “ਘਾਲਿ ਖਾਇ ਕਿਛੁ ਹਥਹੁ ਦੇਇ, ਨਾਨਕ ਰਾਹੁ ਪਛਾਣਹਿ ਸੇਈ।” ਇਹ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਦੱਸਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਸਚੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਉਹੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਕੇ ਖਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੇਵਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਕਈ ਵਾਰੀ ਲੋਕ ਸੋਚਦੇ ਹਨ ਕਿ ਕਿਸਮਤ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਮਿਲਦੀ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਇਹ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਧਾਰਨਾ ਹੈ – ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਜੋ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਕਿਸਮਤ &apos;ਤੇ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਕਰਕੇ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰਦਾ, ਉਹ ਅਖੀਰਕਾਰ ਪਛਤਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉਲਟ, ਜੋ ਲੋਕ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਉਹ ਆਪਣੀ ਕਿਸਮਤ ਖੁਦ ਲਿਖਦੇ ਹਨ। ਜਿਵੇਂ ਮਾਸਟਰ ਕਰਤਾਰ ਸਿੰਘ ਸਰਾਬ੍ਹਾ ਨੇ ਨੌਜਵਾਨੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੀ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਜਜ਼ਬਾ ਵਿਖਾਇਆ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਸਦੀ ਦੇ ਹੀਰੋ ਬਣ ਗਏ – ਇਹ ਮਿਹਨਤ; ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ ਅਤੇ ਬਲਿਦਾਨ ਦੀ ਮਿਸਾਲ ਹੈ। ਪੀ.ਵੀ. ਸਿੰਧੂ ਨੇ ਬੈਡਮਿੰਟਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਜਿਹੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕੀਤੀ ਕਿ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਨੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਲਾਮ ਕੀਤਾ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਕੁਝ ਹੋਰ ਗੁਣ ਵੀ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹਨ – ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਕਦਰ, ਦਿਸ਼ਾ ਦਾ ਚੋਣ, ਆਤਮ-ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ; ਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਧੀਰਜ। ਜੇਕਰ ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਗੁਣਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਜੋੜੀ ਜਾਵੇ, ਤਾਂ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਰੋਕਣਾ ਔਖਾ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਅਸਲ ਸਫਲ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਉਹ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਚੁਪ ਚਾਪ, ਲਗਾਤਾਰ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਹਰ ਦਿਨ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨੂੰ ਬਿਹਤਰ ਬਣਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਕੁਝ ਨਵਾਂ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਅੰਤ ਵਿੱਚ, ਇਹ ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਹੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੀ ਕੁੰਜੀ ਹੈ। ਜਿਸ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਬੀਜ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਪੌਧਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਉਗਦਾ, ਉਸੇ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਮਿਲਦੀ। ਇਹ ਇੱਕ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਹਥਿਆਰ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਆਪਣੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਹਰ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਿਲ ਨੂੰ ਹਰਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸਰੀਰਕ ਕੰਮ ਨਹੀਂ, ਇਹ ਮਨ, ਦਿਲ ਅਤੇ ਆਤਮਾ ਦੀ ਸ਼ੁੱਧਤਾ ਵੀ ਹੈ। ਅਸੀਂ ਜੇ ਅੱਜ ਤੋਂ ਹੀ ਆਪਣੀ ਦਿਸ਼ਾ ਨੂੰ ਸਹੀ ਕਰਕੇ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਨੀ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰੀਏ, ਤਾਂ ਕੱਲ੍ਹ ਸਾਡਾ ਹੋਵੇਗਾ।

ਟੈਕਨੋਲੋਜੀ ਅੱਜ ਦੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਉਹ ਤਾਕਤਵਰ ਸ਼ਕਤੀ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਨੇ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਪ੍ਰਾਇਕਰ ਤੌਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਹਰ ਪਹਲੂ ਨੂੰ ਬੁਨਿਆਦੀ ਤੌਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਬਦਲ ਕੇ ਰੱਖ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਸੌਚ, ਆਪਣੀ ਰਚਨਾਤਮਕਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਖੋਜ-ਪ੍ਰਵ੍ਰਿੱਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਸਮੇਂ-ਸਮੇਂ &apos;ਤੇ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਦਿਸ਼ਾਵਾਂ ਵੱਲ ਮੋੜਿਆ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਸਾਰੀ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਟੈਕਨੋਲੋਜੀ ਦੇ ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਸ਼ਾਲ ਸਥੰਭ ਵਜੋਂ ਸਾਡੇ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਖੜ੍ਹੀ ਹੈ। ਟੈਕਨੋਲੋਜੀ ਦੀ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਮਨੁੱਖਤਾ ਦੀ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਹੈ— ਜੋ ਪਹਿਲਿਆਂ ਪੱਥਰਾਂ ਦੇ ਹਥਿਆਰ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਹੋ ਕੇ ਅੱਜ ਕ੍ਰਿਤ੍ਰਿਮ ਬੁੱਧੀ, ਕਵਾਂਟਮ ਕੰਪਿਊਟਿੰਗ, ਰੋਬੋਟਿਕਸ, ਜੀਵ-ਵਿਗਿਆਨਕ ਇੰਜੀਨੀਅਰਿੰਗ, ਅੰਤਰਿਕਸ਼ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ ਅਤੇ ਇੰਟਰਨੈਟ ਦੇ ਜ਼ਰੀਏ ਇਕ ਗਲੋਬਲ ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਜਗਤ ਦੀ ਰਚਨਾ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਗਈ ਹੈ। ਟੈਕਨੋਲੋਜੀ ਨੇ ਸਮਾਜਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਤਬਦੀਲ ਕੀਤਾ ਹੈ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਬਾਹਰੀ ਤੌਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਗੋਂ ਅੰਦਰੂਨੀ ਤੌਰ &apos;ਤੇ ਵੀ। ਅੱਜ ਦਾ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਉਹ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਕੁਝ ਸੈਕੰਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਲਈ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਖੋਜਕਾਰਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਵਰ੍ਹੇ ਲੱਗਦੇ ਸਨ। ਇੰਟਰਨੈਟ ਅਤੇ ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਕਮਿਊਨੀਕੇਸ਼ਨ ਨੇ ਭਾਸ਼ਾਵਾਂ, ਸੰਸਕ੍ਰਿਤੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਦੇਸ਼ਾ ਦੇ ਵਿਚਕਾਰ ਬਣੀਆਂ ਦੂਰੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਲਗਭਗ ਮਿਟਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਮੋਬਾਈਲ ਫੋਨ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਰਟ ਡਿਵਾਈਸਾਂ ਨੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਜੀਵਨ-ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਨੂੰ ਸੁਧਾਰਿਆ ਹੈ, ਕੰਮ ਨੂੰ ਆਸਾਨ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ, ਕਾਰੋਬਾਰ, ਮਨੋਰੰਜਨ ਅਤੇ ਰਿਸਰਚ ਦੇ ਖੇਤਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਈ ਗੁਣਾ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਸੰਭਾਵਨਾਵਾਂ ਪੈਦਾ ਕੀਤੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਜਿੱਥੇ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਇੱਕ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਨੂੰ ਇਕ ਥਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਦੂਜੀ ਥਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚਣ ਲਈ ਦਿਨਾਂ-ਹਫ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਦਾ ਸਮਾਂ ਲੱਗਦਾ ਸੀ, ਉੱਥੇ ਅੱਜ ਇੱਕ ਸੰਦੇਸ਼ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਦੇ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਕੋਨੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਸੈਕੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਮੀਡੀਆ ਨੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਆਪਸੀ ਗੱਲਬਾਤ ਦੇ ਢੰਗ ਨੂੰ ਬਦਲ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ। ਇੰਸਟਾਗ੍ਰਾਮ, ਫ਼ੇਸਬੁੱਕ, ਯੂਟਿਊਬ ਅਤੇ ਟਿਕਟੋਕ ਨੇ ਕਲਾ, ਗਿਆਨ, ਵਿਅਕਤੀਗਤ ਬ੍ਰਾਂਡਿੰਗ ਅਤੇ ਮਨੋਰੰਜਨ ਨੂੰ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਪਹਚਾਣਾਂ ਦਿੱਤੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਟੈਕਨੋਲੋਜੀ ਨੇ ਸ਼ਬਦਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਅਵਾਜ਼ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਹੈ, ਵਿਚਾਰਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਉਡਾਣ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਇਕ-ਦੂਜੇ ਨਾਲ ਜੁੜਨ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਪੂਰੀ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਨਵੀਂ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਹੈ। ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੇ ਖੇਤਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਟੈਕਨੋਲੋਜੀ ਦੀ ਭੂਮਿਕਾ ਕਾਬਲੇ-ਸਿਤਾਇਸ਼ ਹੈ। ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਇੱਕ ਕਮਰੇ, ਇੱਕ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਅਤੇ ਕੁਝ ਕਾਪੀਆਂ–ਪੁਸਤਕਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਹੀ ਸੀਮਿਤ ਰਹਿੰਦੀ ਸੀ, ਪਰ ਅੱਜ ਇ–ਲਰਨਿੰਗ ਪਲੇਟਫਾਰਮਾਂ, ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਲਾਇਬ੍ਰੇਰੀਆਂ, ਓਨਲਾਈਨ ਕੋਰਸਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਵਰਚੁਅਲ ਕਲਾਸਰੂਮਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਨੂੰ ਬੇਹਦ ਆਸਾਨ ਬਣਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ।

ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਉਹ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਜਾਂ ਉਦਯੋਗ ਦੁਆਰਾ ਵਾਤਾਵਰਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਜਿਹੇ ਤੱਤ ਮਿਲਾ ਦਿੱਤੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਜੋ ਨੁਕਸਾਨਦਾਇਕ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਤੱਤ ਸਿਰਫ ਜੈਵਿਕ ਜੀਵਨ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਅਜੈਵਿਕ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆਵਾਂ ਤੇ ਵੀ ਨਕਾਰਾਤਮਕ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵ ਪਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਹਵਾ ਵਿਚ ਫੈਲ ਰਹੀ ਧੂੜ, ਧੂੰਆ, ਕਾਰਬਨ ਮੋਨੋਕਸਾਈਡ, ਨਾਈਟਰੋਜਨ ਆਕਸਾਈਡ, ਅੰਮੋਨੀਆ ਆਦਿ ਵਾਯੂਆਂ ਨੇ ਹਵਾਈ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਦਾ ਰੂਪ ਧਾਰ ਲਿਆ ਹੈ। ਅਸਥਮਾ, ਬ੍ਰਾਂਕਾਈਟਿਸ, ਅਲਰਜੀ, ਅਤੇ ਫੇਫੜਿਆਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਇਸ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਬੰਧਿਤ ਹਨ। ਉਦਯੋਗਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਨਿਕਲਣ ਵਾਲੇ ਕੇਮੀਕਲ, ਘਰੇਲੂ ਗੰਦਗੀ, ਗਟੜਾਂ ਦੇ ਪਾਣੀ ਨੂੰ ਦਰਿਆਵਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੁੱਟਣਾ, ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਰਤੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਰਸਾਇਣ, ਕੀਟਨਾਸ਼ਕ, ਤੇ ਖਾਦਾਂ— ਨੇ ਨਦੀਆਂ, ਝੀਲਾਂ, ਤਲਾਵਾਂ ਤੇ ਜ਼ਮੀਨੀ ਪਾਣੀ ਨੂੰ ਵੀ ਜ਼ਹਿਰੀਲਾ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਹੈ। ਭਾਰਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਗੰਗਾ ਅਤੇ ਯਮੁਨਾ ਨਦੀਆਂ ਵਿਚਲੇ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਗੁਣਵੱਤਾ ਇਸ ਹੱਦ ਤੱਕ ਗਿਰ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਕਈ ਥਾਵਾਂ ਤੇ ਉਹ ਸਾਫ਼ ਪੀਣਯੋਗ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਿਹਾ। ਇਸ ਨਾਲ ਜਲਜੀਵਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਖਤਰਾ ਪੈਦਾ ਹੋ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਪਾਣੀ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਸਿਹਤ ਲਈ ਵੀ ਖ਼ਤਰਨਾਕ ਬਣ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਟਾਇਫਾਇਡ; ਹੈਜਾ, ਡੈੰਗੀ, ਤੇ ਜੰਡਿਸ ਵਰਗੀਆਂ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਵਧ ਰਹੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਮਿੱਟੀ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਵੀ ਇੱਕ ਅਣਖੱਤਮ ਸਮੱਸਿਆ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ। ਪਲਾਸਟਿਕ, ਰਸਾਇਣਕ ਖਾਦਾਂ, ਝੂਠੇ ਇਲਾਜੀ ਹੱਲ, ਤੇ ਇਲੈਕਟ੍ਰਾਨਿਕ ਕਚਰਾ ਸਿੱਧਾ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਦੀ ਗੁਣਵੱਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਕਰ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਰਸਾਇਣ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਵਿਚ ਮਿਲ ਕੇ ਉਸ ਦੀ ਪੈਦਾਵਾਰ ਘਟਾ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਜਿਸ ਕਾਰਨ ਖੇਤੀ ਉੱਤੇ ਭਾਰੀ ਅਸਰ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਨਾਲ, ਧੁਨ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਅਤੇ ਰੌਸ਼ਨੀ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਵੀ ਆਮ ਜੀਵਨ ਦਾ ਅਟੁੱਟ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕੇ ਹਨ। ਵਿਆਹਾਂ ਵਿਚ ਲੱਗੇ ਲਾਊਡ ਸਪੀਕਰ, ਸੜਕਾਂ ਤੇ ਵਧ ਰਹੇ ਵਾਹਨ, ਅਤੇ ਉਦਯੋਗਿਕ ਮਸ਼ੀਨਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਆਵਾਜ਼ਾਂ, ਧੁਨ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ: ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡਾ ਸਰੋਤ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਸਨੂੰਨ ਸਮਰਥਾ ਨੂੰ ਘਟਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨਿਕ ਤਣਾਅ ਪੈਦਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਅਤੇ ਪੈਟ੍ਰੋਲ ਟੈਂਕੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਇੰਜਣਾਂ ਦੇ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਨਿਕਲਣ ਵਾਲੀ ਗੂੰਜ ਵੀ ਥਕਾਵਟ ਦਾ ਕਾਰਨ ਬਣਦੀ ਹੈ। ਰੌਸ਼ਨੀ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਨਾਲ ਸ਼ਹਿਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਾਰੇ ਨਹੀਂ ਦਿਖਦੇ, ਜੀਵ-ਜੰਤੂਆਂ ਦੇ ਦਿਨ-ਰਾਤ ਦੇ ਠੀਕਰੇ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਅਤੇ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਨੀਂਦ ਵਿਚ ਰੁਕਾਵਟ ਪੈਦੀ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਸਭ ਤੱਤ ਕੇਵਲ ਸਿਹਤ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਤੀ ਉੱਤੇ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਗੋਂ ਆਰਥਿਕਤਾ ਉੱਤੇ ਵੀ ਬੁਰਾ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵ ਪਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਉਦਾਹਰਨ ਵਜੋਂ, ਜਦੋਂ ਕੋਈ ਇਲਾਕਾ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਿਤ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਉੱਥੇ ਸੈਰ-ਸਪਾਟਾ ਘੱਟ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਦੋਂ ਖੇਤੀਯੋਗ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਤੋਂ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਿਤ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ, ਤਦੋਂ ਪੈਦਾਵਾਰ ਘਟਦੀ ਹੈ, ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਤੇ ਆਮ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਉੱਤੇ ਭਾਰੀ ਆਰਥਿਕ ਦਬਾਅ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਇੱਕ ਬਹੁਤ ਵੱਡਾ ਵਿਸ਼ਾਲ ਰੁੱਖ ਸੀ। ਉਸ ਤੇ ਦਰਜਨਾਂ ਹੰਸ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ। ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਬਹੁਤ ਸਿਆਣਾ ਹੰਸ ਸੀ, ਸਭ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਜ਼ਤ ਨਾਲ &apos;ਤਾਇਆ&apos; ਕਹਿਕੇ ਬੁਲਾਉਂਦੇ ਸਨ। ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਉਸਨੇ ਇੱਕ ਛੋਟੀ–ਜਿਹੀ ਵੇਲ ਨੂੰ ਰੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਤਣੇ ਤੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਚਿੰਮੜਿਆ ਪਾਇਆ। ਤਾਏ ਨੇ ਦੂਜੇ ਹੰਸਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸੱਦ ਕੇ ਕਿਹਾ, ਵੇਖੋ, ਇਸ ਵੇਲ ਨੂੰ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਕਰ ਦੇਵੋ। ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਇਹ ਵੇਲ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਸਾਰਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਮੌਤ ਦੇ ਮੂੰਹ ਵਿੱਚ ਲੈ ਜਾਵੇਗੀ। ਹੌਲ਼ੀ-ਹੌਲ਼ੀ ਇਹ ਰੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਸਾਰੇ ਤਣੇ ਨੂੰ ਲਪੇਟਾ ਮਾਰਕੇ ਉਪਰ ਤੱਕ ਆ ਜਾਵੇਗੀ। ਫਿਰ ਵੇਲ ਦਾ ਤਣਾ ਮੋਟਾ ਹੋਣ ਲੱਗੇਗਾ ਅਤੇ ਰੁੱਖ ਨਾਲ ਚਿਪਕ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ, ਤਦ ਹੇਠੋਂ ਉਪਰ ਤਕ ਰੁੱਖ ਤੇ ਚੜ੍ਹਣ ਲਈ ਪੌੜੀ ਬਣ ਜਾਵੇਗੀ। ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਸ਼ਿਕਾਰੀ ਪੌੜੀ ਦੇ ਸਹਾਰੇ ਚੜ੍ਹ ਕੇ ਸਾਡੇ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਜਾਏਗਾ ਅਤੇ ਅਸੀਂ ਸਾਰੇ ਮਾਰੇ ਜਾਵਾਂਗੇ, ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਹੰਸ ਨੇ ਤਾਏ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਨੂੰ ਗੰਭੀਰਤਾ ਨਾਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਲਿਆ। ਵੇਲ ਦਾ ਤਣਾ ਮੋਟਾ ਹੋਣਾ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਹੋਇਆ ਅਤੇ ਸਚਮੁੱਚ ਹੀ ਰੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਤਣੇ ਤੇ ਪੌੜੀ ਬਣ ਗਈ। ਜਿਸ ਤੇ ਸੌਖ ਨਾਲ ਚੜਿਆ ਜਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਸੀ। ਸਾਰਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਤਾਏ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਦੀ ਸੱਚਾਈ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਨਜ਼ਰ ਆਉਣ ਲੱਗੀ। ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਜਦੋਂ ਸਾਰੇ ਹੰਸ ਦਾਣਾ ਚੁਗਣ ਬਾਹਰ ਗਏ ਹੋਏ ਸਨ ਤਦ ਇੱਕ ਚਿੜੀਮਾਰ ਉਧਰ ਆ ਨਿਕਲਿਆ। ਰੁੱਖ ਤੇ ਬਣੀ ਪੌੜੀ ਨੂੰ ਵੇਖਦੇ ਹੀ ਉਸਨੇ ਰੁੱਖ ਤੇ ਚੜ੍ਹ ਕੇ ਜਾਲ ਵਿਛਾਇਆ ਅਤੇ ਚਲਾ ਗਿਆ। ਸਾਂਝ ਨੂੰ ਸਾਰੇ ਹੰਸ ਪਰਤ ਆਏ ਅਤੇ ਰੁੱਖ ਤੇ ਉੱਤਰੇ ਤਾਂ ਚਿੜੀਮਾਰ ਦੇ ਜਾਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੁਰੀ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਫਸ ਗਏ। ਜਦੋਂ ਉਹ ਜਾਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਫਸ ਗਏ ਅਤੇ ਫੜਫੜਾਉਣ ਲੱਗੇ, ਤਦ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਤਾਏ ਦੀ ਅਕਲਮੰਦੀ ਅਤੇ ਦੂਰ-ਦ੍ਰਿਸ਼ਟੀ ਦਾ ਪਤਾ ਲਗਾ। ਸਭ ਤਾਏ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਨਾ ਮੰਨਣ ਲਈ ਸ਼ਰਮਿੰਦਾ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨੂੰ ਕੋਸ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ। ਤਾਇਆ ਸਭ ਨਾਲ ਰੁਸ਼ਟ ਸੀ ਅਤੇ ਚੁਪ ਬੈਠਾ ਹੋਇਆ ਸੀ।ਇੱਕ ਹੰਸ ਨੇ ਹਿੰਮਤ ਕਰਕੇ ਕਿਹਾ, ਤਾਇਆ, ਅਸੀਂ ਮੂਰਖ ਹਾਂ, ਲੇਕਿਨ ਹੁਣ ਸਾਡੇ ਤੋਂ ਮੂੰਹ ਨਾ ਫੇਰੋ। ਦੂਜਾ ਹੰਸ ਬੋਲਿਆ, ਇਸ ਸੰਕਟ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਨਿਕਲਣ ਦੀ ਤਰਕੀਬ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਹੀ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਦੱਸ ਸਕਦੇ ਹੋ। ਅੱਗੇ ਤੋਂ ਅਸੀਂ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਕੋਈ ਗੱਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਟਾਲਾਂਗੇ। ਸਵੇਰੇ ਜਦੋਂ ਚਿੜੀਮਾਰ ਆਵੇਗਾ, ਤਦ ਮੁਰਦਾ ਹੋਣ ਦਾ ਡਰਾਮਾ ਕਰਨਾ। ਚਿੜੀਮਾਰ ਥੋਨੂੰ ਮੁਰਦਾ ਸਮਝ ਕੇ ਜਾਲ ਤੋਂ ਕੱਢ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਤੇ ਰਖਦਾ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ। ਉੱਥੇ ਵੀ ਮਰਿਆਂ ਵਾਂਗ ਪਏ ਰਹਿਣਾ। ਜਿਵੇਂ ਹੀ ਉਹ ਅਖੀਰਲੇ ਹੰਸ ਨੂੰ ਹੇਠਾਂ ਰੱਖੇਗਾ, ਮੈਂ ਸੀਟੀ ਬਜਾਊਂਗਾ। &quot;ਮੇਰੀ ਸੀਟੀ ਸੁਣਦੇ ਹੀ ਸਭਨਾਂ ਨੇ ਉੱਡ ਜਾਣਾ।&quot; ਸਵੇਰੇ ਚਿੜੀਮਾਰ ਆਇਆ। ਹੰਸਾਂ ਨੇ ਉਵੇਂ ਹੀ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਤਾਏ ਨੇ ਸਮਝਾਇਆ ਸੀ। ਸਚਮੁੱਚ ਚਿੜੀਮਾਰ ਹੰਸਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਮੁਰਦਾ ਸਮਝ ਕੇ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਤੇ ਪਟਕਦਾ ਗਿਆ। ਸੀਟੀ ਦੀ ਅਵਾਜ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਸਾਰੇ ਹੰਸ ਉੱਡ ਗਏ। ਚਿੜੀਮਾਰ ਅਵਾਕ ਹੋਕੇ ਵੇਖਦਾ ਰਹਿ ਗਿਆ।

ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਦੇ ਉਹ ਹਾਸੇ ਅਤੇ ਸ਼ਹੀਦੀਆਂ ਭਰਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਸੰਗ ਹਨ, ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਬੇਹਦ ਜਵਾਨੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਅਤੇ ਮਾਤਰਭੂਮੀ ਲਈ ਸ਼ਹਾਦਤ ਦੇ ਕੇ ਸਾਰੀ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਨੂੰ ਹੈਰਾਨ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ। ਇਹ ਛੋਟੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਪੁੱਤਰ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਕੁਰਬਾਨੀ ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਅਤੇ ਸਿੱਖ ਜਨਤਾ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਰੂਹਾਨੀ ਅਤੇ ਸਾਂਸਕ੍ਰਿਤਿਕ ਮੈਸੇਜ ਛੱਡ ਗਈ ਹੈ। ਛੋਟੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ ਦੀ ਸ਼ਹਾਦਤ ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਦੇ ਆਤਮ-ਗੌਰਵ ਅਤੇ ਮਨੁੱਖਤਾ ਦੀ ਸੱਚਾਈ ਦੀ ਇੱਕ ਬੇਹਤਰੀਨ ਮਿਸਾਲ ਹੈ। ਉਹ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਬੱਚੇ ਜਿੰਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਦੇ ਉੱਤਮ ਅਦਾਰਸ਼ਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਰੂਪਾਂਤਰਿਤ ਕੀਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਜਵਾਨੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਧਰਮ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਆਪਕ ਰਾਜੀ ਨਾਲ ਖ਼ੁਦ ਨੂੰ ਸ਼ਹੀਦ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ। ਅੱਜ ਵੀ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਕੁਰਬਾਨੀ– ਸਿੱਖ ਸੰਪ੍ਰਦਾਇ ਦੇ ਨਜ਼ੀਕ ਗੁਣਵੱਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਦੇ ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਿਊਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਨੇ ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਦੀ ਸੰਸਥਾ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਨਵੀਂ ਉਚਾਈ ਤੇ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਇਆ। ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਵਿਦਿਆ, ਧਰਮ, ਤਰੱਕੀ ਅਤੇ ਖੁਸ਼ਹਾਲੀ ਦੇ ਅਦਾਰਸ਼ਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਮਾਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਦਲਾਵ ਅਤੇ ਸੱਚਾਈ ਲਈ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ ਦੇ ਖੇਤਰ ਖੋਲ੍ਹੇ। ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਪੰਜਵੇਂ ਅਤੇ ਅਖੀਰਲੇ ਬੇਟੇ ਛੋਟੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ ਪੂਰਨ ਬਰਖ਼ਰਾਸ ਅਤੇ ਗ਼ਲਤੀਆਂ ਤੋਂ ਮੁਕਤ ਹਕੀਕਤ ਦੇ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਕ ਬਣੇ। ਉਹ ਸਮਾਂ ਸੀ ਜਦੋਂ ਸਿੱਖ ਰਾਜ ਨੂੰ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣੀ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ ਦੀ ਕਠਿਣਾਈ ਨਾਲ ਗੁਜ਼ਰਨਾ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਸੀ। ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਖ਼ਾਲਿਸਤਾਨ ਵਿਰੋਧੀ ਦਲਾਂ ਦੇ ਇਲਾਵਾ, ਬਾਬਰ ਅਤੇ ਆਨਦਾਖ਼ਿਸ਼ਨ ਜ਼ੁਲਮਾਂ ਦੇ ਸੰਕਟ ਦਾ ਸਾਹਮਣਾ ਹੋ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ। ਪਰ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਪੁੱਤਰ ਛੋਟੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ ਨੂੰ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਸੂਰਵਾਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਗਿਆ। ਅਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਅਤੇ ਜੂਰੀ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੀ ਸਹਾਇਤਾ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲੀ ਪ੍ਰਣਾਲੀ ਬੇਹਦ ਤਾਕਤਵਰ ਸੀ। ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਸ਼ਹਾਦਤ ਅਤੇ ਜਿੱਤ ਠਹਿਰਾਉਣ ਵਾਲੇ ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਦੇ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਨੂੰ ਦੂਰ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲੇ ਸੀ। ਉਹ ਸਮਝਦੇ ਸਨ ਕਿ ਆਪਣੇ ਧਰਮ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਦੇ ਆਦਾਰਸ਼ਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਥਾਪਿਤ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲੇ ਸੰਪੂਰਨ ਜਵਾਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਦਦ ਨਾਲ ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਨੂੰ ਜਿੱਤਣਾ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਚਾਰਿਤ ਕਰਨਾ ਸੰਭਵ ਹੈ। # ਉਹ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਦੁਖਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣੀ ਦਾ ਅਹਿਸਾਸ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰ ਸਕੇ। ਛੋਟੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ ਗੁਰੂ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਹਰ ਦਿਸ਼ੇ ਦੀ ਮਹੱਤਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਰਥਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਸੁਧਾਰਕ ਰੂਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਲਤ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ। ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਮਾਤਾ-ਪਿਤਾ ਦੇ ਕਈ ਬੇਹਦ ਅਦਾਰਸ਼ਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਮਲ ਕਰਦੇ ਸੀ ਅਤੇ ਉਹ ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਜਵਾਨ ਹੌਂਸਲੇ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਦਿਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਾਲਣ ਵਾਲੇ ਜਵਾਨ ਸੀ।

ਦੇਸ ਨੂੰ ਆਜ਼ਾਦ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਬ੍ਰਿਟਿਸ਼ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਨੇ ੧੫ ਅਗਸਤ ੧੯੪੭ਈ. ਨੂੰ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਨੂੰ ਦੋ ਹਿੱਸਿਆਂ ਵਿਚ ਵੰਡ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਪੱਛਮੀ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਅਤੇ ਪੂਰਬੀ ਪੰਜਾਬ। ਇਹ ਵੰਡ ਕੋਈ ਅਚਨਚੇਤ ਘਟਨਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ , ਸਗੋਂ ਇਸ ਦਾ ਲੰਬਾ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਦਾ ਉਦਘਾਟਨ ਬ੍ਰਿਟਿਸ਼ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਦੀ &apos;ਫੁਟ ਪਾਓ ਤੇ ਰਾਜ ਕਰੋ&apos; ਨੀਤੀ ਤੋਂ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਿਉਂ ਜਿਉਂ ਵਖ-ਵਾਦੀ ਪਰਿਸਥਿਤੀਆਂ ਜਨਮ ਲੈਂਦੀਆਂ ਗਈਆਂ, ਵੰਡ ਦਾ ਸੰਕਲਪ ਦ੍ਰਿੜ੍ਹ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਗਿਆ। ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਪਰਿਸਥਿਤੀਆਂ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਕੁਝ ਦਾ ਵੇਰਵਾ ਇਸ ਪ੍ਰਕਾਰ ਹੈ: ਸੰਪ੍ਰਦਾਇਕਤਾ ਦਾ ਉਭਾਰ ਜਿਸ ਦਾ ਮੂਲ ਕਾਰਣ ਹਿੰਦੂ-ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨਾਂ ਵਿਚ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਏਕਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਸਦਭਾਵਨਾ ਦਾ ਕਾਇਮ ਨ ਰਹਿ ਸਕਣਾ ਸੀ। ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਹਿੰਦੂ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਵਖਰੇਵੇਂ ਵਾਲਾ ਵਿਵਹਾਰ ਕਰਦੇ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨਾਂ ਦਾ ਰਵੈਯਾ ਧਾਰਮਿਕ ਆਕ੍ਰਮਣਕਾਰਤਾ ਵਾਲਾ ਸੀ। ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਉਲਝੀ ਹੋਈ ਸੰਪ੍ਰਦਾਇਕ ਸਥਿਤੀ ਜਿਸ ਦਾ ਕਾਰਣ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਵਿਚ ਦੋ ਦੀ ਥਾਂ ਤਿੰਨ ਧਾਰਮਿਕ ਵਰਗ ਸਨ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ, ਹਿੰਦੂ ਅਤੇ ਸਿੱਖ। ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ੫੭ ਪ੍ਰਤਿਸ਼ਤ, ਹਿੰਦੂ ੩੦ ਪ੍ਰਤਿਸ਼ਤ ਅਤੇ ਸਿੱਖ ੧੩ ਪ੍ਰਤਿਸ਼ਤ ਸਨ। ਇਸ ਸੂਬੇ ਵਿਚ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਬਹ-ਸੰਖਿਅਕ ਹੋਣ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਲਈ ਵਖਰੀ ਚੋਣ ਦੀ ਵਿਵਸਥਾ ਸੀ। ਕਾਰਣ ਇਹ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਆਰਥਿਕ ਪੱਖ ਤੋਂ ਹਿੰਦੂਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਸਿੱਖਾਂ ਦੇ ਮੁਕਾਬਲੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ ਸਨ। ਉਪਰੋਕਤ ਕਾਰਣਾਂ ਕਰਕੇ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਵੰਡ ਦੇ ਬੀਜ ਰੂਪ ਵਿਚ ਕਈ ਵਿਚਾਰ ਉਭਰਨ ਲਗੇ। ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਸੰਨ ੧੯੨੪ ਈ. ਵਿਚ ਲਾਲਾ ਲਾਜਪਤ ਰਾਏ ਨੇ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਪ੍ਰਾਂਤ ਦੀ ਸੰਪ੍ਰਦਾਇਕ ਸਮਸਿਆ ਦੇ ਹਲ ਲਈ ਇਸ ਨੂੰ ਦੋ ਪ੍ਰਾਂਤਾਂ ਵਿਚ ਵੰਡਣ ਦੀ ਤਜਵੀਜ਼ ਪੇਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ ਇਕ ਪੱਛਮੀ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਵਿਚ ਜਿਸ ਵਿਚ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਬਹੁਸੰਖਿਅਕ ਹੋਣ ਅਤੇ ਦੂਜਾ ਪੂਰਬੀ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਜਿਸ ਵਿਚ ਹਿੰਦੂ-ਸਿੱਖ ਅਧਿਕ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਵਿਚ ਹੋਣ। ਉਸ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਦ ਸੰਨ ੧੯੨੫ ਈ. ਵਿਚ ਸਰ ਜਿਓਫ਼ਰੀ ਕਾਰਬੈਟ ਨੇ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਨਾਲੋਂ ਅੰਬਾਲਾ ਕਮਿਸ਼ਨਰੀ ਨੂੰ ਵਖ ਕਰਨ ਦਾ ਸੁਝਾਵ ਰਖਿਆ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਸ ਖੇਤਰ ਦੀ ਭਾਸ਼ਾ ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਨਾਲੋਂ ਵਖਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਹਿੰਦੀ ਸੀ। ਤੀਜਾ ਸੁਝਾਵ ਸ. ਉਜਲ ਸਿੰਘ ਦਾ ਸੀ ਜੋ ਉਸ ਨੇ ਸੰਨ ੧੯੩੧ ਈ. ਵਿਚ ਲੰਡਨ ਵਿਚ ਹੋਈ ਦੂਜੀ ਗੋਲ ਮੇਜ਼ ਕਾਨਫ੍ਰੰਸ ਵਿਚ ਸਿੱਖ ਪ੍ਰਤਿਨਿਧੀ ਮੰਡਲ ਦੇ ਨੇਤਾ ਵਜੋਂ ਰਖਿਆ ਸੀ। ਉਸ ਦਾ ਵਿਚਾਰ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਲਾਇਲਪੁਰ ਅਤੇ ਮੰਟਗੁਮਰੀ ਜ਼ਿਲ੍ਹਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਛਡ ਕੇ ਰਾਵਲਪਿੰਡੀ ਅਤੇ ਮੁਲਤਾਨ ਕਮਿਸ਼ਨਰੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਉੱਤਰ-ਪੱਛਮੀ ਸਰਹਦੀ ਸੂਬੇ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਲਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਜਾਏ। ਇਸ ਨਾਲ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਵਿਚ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਜਨ-ਸੰਖਿਆ ਘਟ ਜਾਏਗੀ ਅਤੇ ਤਿੰਨੋਂ ਫ਼ਿਰਕੇ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਇਕ ਦੂਜੇ ਦਾ ਸਹਿਯੋਗ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਨਗੇ।

ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ ਉਹ ਕੁਦਰਤੀ ਪਰਿਸਥਿਤੀ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਸੀਂ ਜੀਵਨ ਬਿਤਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਾਂ, ਜਿਸ ਤੋਂ ਅਸੀਂ ਸਾਹ ਲੈਣ ਲਈ ਹਵਾ, ਪੀਣ ਲਈ ਪਾਣੀ, ਖਾਣ ਲਈ ਭੋਜਨ, ਰਹਿਣ ਲਈ ਜਗ੍ਹਾ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਹਰ ਲੋੜੀਂਦੀ ਚੀਜ਼ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਾਂ; ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਹਵਾ, ਪਾਣੀ, ਮਿੱਟੀ, ਦਰੱਖ਼ਤ, ਪਹਾੜ, ਜਾਨਵਰ, ਪੌਦੇ, ਨਦੀਆਂ, ਸਮੁੰਦਰ, ਦਰਿਆਈ ਪ੍ਰਣਾਲੀਆਂ, ਜੀਵ-ਜਨਤੂ, ਮੌਸਮ, ਤਾਪਮਾਨ ਅਤੇ ਪੂਰਾ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਣਿਕ ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੈ, ਜੋ ਧਰਤੀ &apos;ਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਲਗਾਤਾਰਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਬਣਾਈ ਰੱਖਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਸ਼ੁਰੂਆਤ ਤੋਂ ਹੀ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਅਤੇ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਦਾ ਰਿਸ਼ਤਾ ਇੱਕ ਦੂਜੇ &apos;ਤੇ ਨਿਰਭਰ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜਨਸੰਖਿਆ ਵਧਦੀ ਗਈ, ਤਰੱਕੀ ਦੀ ਦੌੜ ਤੇਜ਼ ਹੋਈ ਅਤੇ ਧੰਦੇ ਫੈਲੇ, ਮਨੁੱਖ ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ ਤੋਂ ਬੇਅੰਤ ਲਾਭ ਤਾਂ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਗਇਆ, ਪਰ ਇਸ ਦੀ ਸੰਭਾਲ ਅਤੇ ਸੁਰੱਖਿਆ ਵੱਲੋਂ ਲਾਪਰਵਾਹ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ। ਅੱਜ ਸੰਸਾਰ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡੇ ਪਰਿਆਵਰਣ ਸੰਕਟ ਦਾ ਸਾਹਮਣਾ ਕਰ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ ਜੰਗਲਾਂ ਦੀ ਕਟਾਈ, ਗਲੋਬਲ ਵਾਰਮਿੰਗ, ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਦਾ ਵਾਧਾ, ਓਜ਼ੋਨ ਪਰਤ ਦੀ ਖਰਾਬੀ, ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਘਾਟ, ਜੈਵਿਕ ਵਿਭਿੰਨਤਾ ਦੀ ਕਮੀ, ਦਰਿਆਵਾਂ ਦੀ ਦੂਸ਼ਣ, ਮਿੱਟੀ ਦੀ ਉਪਜਾਊ ਸ਼ਕਤੀ ਦਾ ਘਟਣਾ ਤੇ ਮੌਸਮੀ ਤਬਦੀਲੀਆਂ ਇਹ ਸਭ ਇੱਕ-ਦੂਜੇ ਨਾਲ ਜੁੜੇ ਹੋਏ ਗੰਭੀਰ ਮੁੱਦੇ ਹਨ। ਉਦਯੋਗਿਕਰਣ, ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਤਰੱਕੀ ਅਤੇ ਆਧੁਨਿਕਤਾ ਦੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਸਾਰੇ ਲਾਭ ਹਨ, ਪਰ ਇਹ ਪੂਰੀ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦੀ ਲਾਪਰਵਾਹੀ ਅਤੇ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਦੇ ਸ਼ੋਸ਼ਣ ਤੋਂ ਜਨਮੇ ਨੁਕਸਾਨਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਭਰਪੂਰ ਹਨ। ਦੁਨੀਆ ਭਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਣਦੇ ਹਾਲਾਤ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਇਹ ਸਿੱਖਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਕਿ ਜੇ ਅਸੀਂ ਹੁਣ ਵੀ ਨਾ ਜਾਗੇ, ਤਾਂ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਦੀਆਂ ਪੀੜੀਆਂ ਲਈ ਧਰਤੀ ਰਹਿਣ-ਜੋਗੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹਿ ਜਾਵੇਗੀ। ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਮੁੱਖ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਹਵਾ ਹੈ। ਸਾਫ਼ ਹਵਾ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਸਿਹਤ ਲਈ ਬੇਹੱਦ ਲਾਜ਼ਮੀ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਅੱਜ ਹਵਾ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡਾ ਖਤਰਾ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕਾ ਹੈ। ਵਾਹਨਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਨਿਕਲਣ ਵਾਲਾ ਧੂੰਆ, ਫੈਕਟਰੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਰਸਾਇਣਿਕ ਧੂਏਂ, ਪਲਾਸਟਿਕ ਦੇ ਸੜਨ ਨਾਲ ਨਿਕਲਣ ਵਾਲੀਆਂ ਜ਼ਹਰੀਲੀ ਗੈਸਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਜੰਗਲਾਂ ਦੇ ਸੜਨ ਨਾਲ ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਾਰਬਨ ਡਾਈਆਕਸਾਈਡ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਕ ਤੱਤਾਂ ਦਾ ਪੱਧਰ ਬੇਹੱਦ ਵਧ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਨਾਲ ਮਨੁੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਸਥਮਾ, ਹਾਰਟ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ, ਲੰਗ ਕੈਂਸਰ ਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਗੰਭੀਰ ਰੋਗ ਵਧ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ। ਹਵਾ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਣ ਨਾਲ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸਿਹਤ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਗੋਂ ਗਲੋਬਲ ਵਾਰਮਿੰਗ ਦਾ ਖਤਰਾ ਵੀ ਵਧ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਪ੍ਰਦੂਸ਼ਕ ਗੈਸਾਂ ਧਰਤੀ ਦੀ ਸਤ੍ਹਾ ਤੋਂ ਤਾਪਮਾਨ ਨੂੰ ਵਾਪਸ ਬਾਹਰ ਨਿਕਲਣ ਨਹੀਂ ਦਿੰਦੀਆਂ, ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਤਾਪਮਾਨ ਵਧਦਾ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਪਹਾੜੀ ਖੇਤਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਰਫ਼ ਤੇਜ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਪਿਘਲ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ, ਸਮੁੰਦਰੀ ਪੱਧਰ ਵੱਧ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਤੂਫ਼ਾਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਆਵ੍ਰਿੱਤੀ ਵੱਧ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਬਦਲਾਅ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਲਈ ਗੰਭੀਰ ਖਤਰਾ ਹਨ।

ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਦੇ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਕੰਮ ਚਾਹੇ ਉਹ ਨਿੱਜੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਬੰਧਿਤ ਹੋਵੇ, ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਹੋਵੇ ਜਾਂ ਪੇਸ਼ਾਵਰ, ਢੰਗ ਨਾਲ ਸਫਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੋ ਸਕਦਾ। ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਦੀ ਮਹੱਤਤਾ ਅਸੀਂ ਸਧਾਰਣ ਕੰਮਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਵੇਖ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਾਂ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਤੁਰਦੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਅੱਖਾਂ, ਦਿਮਾਗ, ਪੈਰਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਸਰੀਰ ਦੇ ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਦਾ ਆਪਸੀ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ; ਜੇ ਇਹ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਠੀਕ ਨਾ ਰਹੇ ਤਾਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਡਿੱਗ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਾਂ ਚੱਲਣਾ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਸੇ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਬਹੁਤ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ, ਸਮਾਂ-ਪ੍ਰਬੰਧਨ, ਅਧਿਆਪਕਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਬੰਧ ਅਤੇ ਘਰੇਲੂ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰੀਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਹੀ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਹੋਣ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਮਿਲਦੀ ਹੈ; ਉਦਾਹਰਨ ਵਜੋਂ, ਜੇ ਕੋਈ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਆਰਾਮ ਵਿਚ ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਬਣਾਕੇ ਰੱਖਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਉਹ ਬਿਹਤਰ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਹਾਸਲ ਕਰ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਕੰਮਕਾਜੀ ਥਾਵਾਂ ’ਤੇ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਦੀ ਭੂਮਿਕਾ ਹੋਰ ਵੀ ਵੱਡੀ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਵੱਖ-ਵੱਖ ਵਿਭਾਗਾਂ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਉਤਪਾਦਨ, ਵਿਕਰੀ, ਲੇਖਾ-ਜੋਖਾ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਬੰਧਨ ਦੇ ਵਿਚਕਾਰ ਢੰਗ ਦਾ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਨਾ ਹੋਵੇ ਤਾਂ ਸੰਸਥਾ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਦਾ ਸਾਹਮਣਾ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੀ ਹੈ; ਮਿਸਾਲ ਵਜੋਂ, ਜੇ ਉਤਪਾਦਨ ਵਿਭਾਗ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਵਿਕਰੀ ਵਿਭਾਗ ਨਾਲ ਸਲਾਹ ਕੀਤੇ ਵੱਧ ਸਮਾਨ ਤਿਆਰ ਕਰ ਦੇਵੇ ਤਾਂ ਸਟਾਕ ਵਧ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਰਥਿਕ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਖੇਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਇੱਕ ਅਹਿਮ ਕੌਸ਼ਲ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਖਿਡਾਰੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਸਰੀਰ ਦੇ ਹਿੱਸਿਆਂ, ਸੋਚ ਅਤੇ ਟੀਮ ਦੇ ਹੋਰ ਮੈਂਬਰਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਪੂਰਾ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਬਣਾਉਣਾ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ; ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕ੍ਰਿਕਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੱਲੇਬਾਜ਼ ਅੱਖਾਂ, ਪੈਰਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਬੱਲੇ ਦੇ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਗੇਂਦ ਨੂੰ ਸਹੀ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਨਾਲ ਮਾਰ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਿਹਤ ਦੇ ਖੇਤਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਬਹੁਤ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਸਰੀਰ ਦੇ ਵੱਖ-ਵੱਖ ਅੰਗ ਇਕ-ਦੂਜੇ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਲ ਕੇ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ; ਜਿਵੇਂ ਦਿਲ, ਫੇਫੜੇ ਅਤੇ ਮਾਸਪੇਸ਼ੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਸਹੀ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਸਿਹਤਮੰਦ ਜੀਵਨ ਲਈ ਲਾਜ਼ਮੀ ਹੈ। ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਸ਼ਾਂਤੀ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਵਸਥਾ ਬਣੀ ਰਹਿੰਦੀ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਲੋਕ ਨਿਯਮਾਂ ਦੀ ਪਾਲਣਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਇਕ-ਦੂਜੇ ਨਾਲ ਸਹਿਯੋਗ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ; ਉਦਾਹਰਨ ਵਜੋਂ, ਟ੍ਰੈਫਿਕ ਪ੍ਰਣਾਲੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਡਰਾਈਵਰਾਂ, ਪੈਦਲ ਯਾਤਰੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਟ੍ਰੈਫਿਕ ਸਿਗਨਲਾਂ ਦਾ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਨਾ ਹੋਵੇ ਤਾਂ ਹਾਦਸੇ ਵਧ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਸੰਚਾਰ (ਕਮਿਊਨੀਕੇਸ਼ਨ) ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਦਾ ਮੁੱਖ ਅਧਾਰ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਸਪਸ਼ਟ ਗੱਲਬਾਤ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਝ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਲੋਕ ਆਪਣੇ ਕੰਮਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਇਕ ਦੂਜੇ ਨਾਲ ਜੋੜ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ; ਜਿਵੇਂ ਹਸਪਤਾਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਡਾਕਟਰਾਂ, ਨਰਸਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਸਟਾਫ਼ ਦਾ ਸਹੀ ਸੰਯੋਜਨ ਮਰੀਜ਼ ਦੀ ਜਾਨ ਬਚਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਦੇ ਲੰਮੇ ਸਫਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਹਰ ਇਨਸਾਨ ਕਿਸੇ ਨਾ ਕਿਸੇ ਮੋੜ ਤੇ ਇਮਤਿਹਾਨਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਟਕਰਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਵੀ ਇੱਕ ਐਸੇ ਹੀ ਆਮ ਪਰ ਹੌਂਸਲੇ ਨਾਲ ਭਰੇ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦੀ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਦਾ ਨਾਂ ਹਰਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਸੀ ਜੋ ਇੱਕ ਛੋਟੇ ਜਿਹੇ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਲਿਆ ਵਧਿਆ ਸੀ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਸਾਧਨ ਘੱਟ ਸਨ ਪਰ ਸੁਪਨੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਵੱਡੇ ਸਨ ਹਰਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਦੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਸਨ ਜੋ ਸਵੇਰ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ਾਮ ਤੱਕ ਖੇਤਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਅਤੇ ਮਾਂ ਘਰ ਸੰਭਾਲਦੀ ਸੀ ਬਚਪਨ ਤੋਂ ਹੀ ਹਰਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਨੇ ਗਰੀਬੀ ਦੇ ਅਰਥ ਸਿੱਖ ਲਏ ਸਨ ਜਦੋਂ ਉਸਦੇ ਸਾਥੀ ਖਿਲੌਣਿਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਖੇਡਦੇ ਸਨ ਉਹ ਕਿਤਾਬਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਦੋਸਤੀ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਸੀ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਸਦਾ ਮਨ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਵਿੱਚ ਲੱਗਦਾ ਸੀ ਅਤੇ ਉਹ ਜਾਣਦਾ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਹੀ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇਸ ਹਾਲਤ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਹਰ ਕੱਢ ਸਕਦੀ ਹੈ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਣ ਲਈ ਉਹ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਕਿਲੋਮੀਟਰਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪੈਦਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਸੀ ਰਾਹ ਵਿੱਚ ਥਕਾਵਟ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਮਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਅਜੀਬ ਜਿਹਾ ਜੋਸ਼ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਸੀ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਉਸਦੀ ਲਗਨ ਨੂੰ ਦੇਖ ਕੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਹੌਂਸਲਾ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ ਪਰ ਸਮਾਂ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਇੱਕੋ ਜਿਹਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹਿੰਦਾ ਜਦੋਂ ਉਹ ਦਸਵੀਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੀ ਤਾਂ ਪਿਤਾ ਦੀ ਤਬੀਅਤ ਖਰਾਬ ਰਹਿਣ ਲੱਗੀ ਖੇਤਾਂ ਦਾ ਕੰਮ ਠੱਪ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ ਘਰ ਦੀ ਆਮਦਨ ਘੱਟ ਗਈ ਅਤੇ ਕਈ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ ਕਿ ਹੁਣ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਛੱਡ ਕੇ ਕੰਮ ਕਰ ਲੈਣਾ ਚਾਹੀਦਾ ਹੈ ਇਹ ਸ਼ਬਦ ਹਰਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਦੇ ਦਿਲ ਨੂੰ ਚੁਭਦੇ ਸਨ ਪਰ ਉਸਨੇ ਹਾਰ ਮੰਨਣ ਤੋਂ ਇਨਕਾਰ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਉਸਨੇ ਦਿਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਕੀਤੀ ਅਤੇ ਰਾਤ ਨੂੰ ਛੋਟੇ ਮੋਟੇ ਕੰਮ ਕਰ ਕੇ ਘਰ ਦਾ ਖਰਚ ਚਲਾਇਆ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਨੀਂਦ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਦੂਰ ਰਹਿੰਦੀ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਸੁਪਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਜਾਗਦਾ ਰੱਖਦੇ ਸਨ ਇਮਤਿਹਾਨ ਆਏ ਅਤੇ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਆਏ ਹਰਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਨੇ ਸ਼ਾਨਦਾਰ ਅੰਕਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਪਾਸ ਕਰ ਲਿਆ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਦਾ ਮਾਹੌਲ ਬਣ ਗਿਆ ਪਰ ਅਸਲੀ ਲੜਾਈ ਤਾਂ ਹੁਣ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਹੋਣੀ ਸੀ ਕਾਲਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਦਾਖਲਾ ਲੈਣਾ ਸੀ ਫੀਸ ਵੱਡੀ ਸੀ ਪੈਸੇ ਘੱਟ ਸਨ ਉਸਨੇ ਸਕਾਲਰਸ਼ਿਪ ਲਈ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਦਿਨ ਰਾਤ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕੀਤੀ ਅਤੇ ਆਖਿਰਕਾਰ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਮੌਕਾ ਮਿਲ ਗਿਆ ਸ਼ਹਿਰ ਜਾਣਾ ਉਸਦੇ ਲਈ ਨਵਾਂ ਅਨੁਭਵ ਸੀ ਉੱਚੀਆਂ ਇਮਾਰਤਾਂ ਤੇਜ਼ ਰਫਤਾਰ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਅਤੇ ਅਜਨਬੀ ਚਿਹਰੇ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨੂੰ ਬਹੁਤ ਇਕੱਲਾ ਮਹਿਸੂਸ ਕਰਦਾ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਉਹ ਜਾਣਦਾ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਇਕੱਲਾਪਨ ਹੀ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਬਣਾਏਗਾ ਕਾਲਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਈ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਅਮੀਰ ਪਰਿਵਾਰਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਸਨ ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਕੋਲ ਹਰ ਸੁਵਿਧਾ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਹਰਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਕੋਲ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਅਤੇ ਸਬਰ ਸੀ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਗੱਲਾਂ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਅੰਦਰੋਂ ਤੋੜ ਦਿੰਦੀਆਂ ਸਨ ਪਰ ਉਹ ਹਰ ਵਾਰ ਆਪਣੇ ਮਕਸਦ ਨੂੰ ਯਾਦ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਸੀ

ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨਕ ਵਿਗਿਆਨ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਮਨ, ਦਿਮਾਗ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਹਾਰ ਨੂੰ ਸਮਝਣ ਦੀ ਉਹ ਵਿਗਿਆਨਿਕ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਹੇ ਜੋ ਸਦੀ ਦਰ ਸਦੀ ਵਿਕਸਤ ਹੋਈ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਅੱਜ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਹਰ ਪੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਰੌਸ਼ਨ ਕਰ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਵਿਗਿਆਨ ਇਹ ਗਹਿਰਾਈ ਨਾਲ ਖੋਜ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਕੀ ਸੋਚਦਾ ਹੈ, ਕਿਵੇਂ ਮਹਿਸੂਸ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਸਥਿਤੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਿਉਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਖ਼ਾਸ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਨਾਲ ਵਰਤਾਰਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਦਿਮਾਗ ਦੀ ਜਟਿਲਤਾ, ਉਸਦੇ ਨਿਊਰੋਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਗਤੀਵਿਧੀ ਅਤੇ ਦਿਲ-ਦਿਮਾਗ ਵਿੱਚ ਬਣਦੇ ਰਸਾਇਣਕ ਸੰਕੇਤ ਉਸਦੇ ਹਰ ਬਰਤਾਅ ਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਿਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਹ ਗੱਲ ਮੰਨੀ ਗਈ ਹੈ ਕਿ @ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦਾ ਵਿਹਾਰ ਉਸਦੇ ਵੰਸ਼ਣੂ ਤੱਤਾਂ, ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ, ਅਨੁਭਵਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਾਂ ਦੇ ਮਿਲਾਪ ਨਾਲ ਬਣਦਾ ਹੈ। ਹਰ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਦੀ ਵਿਅਕਤਿਤਵ, ਉਸਦੀ ਸੋਚ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਦੀਆਂ ਭਾਵਨਾਵਾਂ ਇਕੋ ਜਿਹੀਆਂ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦੀਆਂ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਹ ਸਭ ਉਸਦੇ ਬਚਪਨ, ਪਰਿਵਾਰ, ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਮਾਹੌਲ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਤਜਰਬਿਆਂ ਤੋਂ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਿਤ ਹੁੰਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨ ਇਹ ਵੀ ਦੱਸਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਯਾਦਦਾਸ਼ਤ ਕਿਵੇਂ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ, ਕਿਉਂ ਕੁਝ ਗੱਲਾਂ ਸਦੀਵੀ ਯਾਦ ਰਹਿ ਜਾਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਕਿਉਂ ਕਈ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਗੱਲਾਂ ਸਮੇਂ ਨਾਲ ਧੁੰਦਲੀਆਂ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਯਾਦਦਾਸ਼ਤ ਦੀ ਬਣਤਰ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਦੀ ਕਾਇਮ ਰਹਿਣ ਦੀ ਯੋਗਤਾ ਦਿਮਾਗ ਦੇ ਨਿਊਰੋਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਸੰਪਰਕਾਂ &apos;ਤੇ ਆਧਾਰਿਤ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਹਰ ਦਿਨ ਦੇ ਅਨੁਭਵਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਜਾਂ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਭਾਵਨਾਵਾਂ ਵੀ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦਾ ਅਟੱਲ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ # ਇਹ ਦਿਲ ਜਾਂ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਮਨ ਦੀ ਉਪਜ ਨਹੀਂ, ਬਲਕਿ ਦਿਮਾਗ ਵਿਚ ਚੱਲਣ ਵਾਲੇ ਰਸਾਇਣਕ ਤੱਤਾਂ ਦਾ ਨਤੀਜਾ ਹੁੰਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਜਦੋਂ ਡੋਪਾਮੀਨ ਵੱਧਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਣਾ, ਉਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਅਤੇ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਦੀ ਭਾਵਨਾ ਵਧਦੀ ਹੈ; ਜਦੋਂ ਸੈਰੋਟੋਨਿਨ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਮਨ ਸ਼ਾਂਤ ਰਹਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ; ਜਦੋਂ ਕੋਰਟੀਸੋਲ ਵਧਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਤਣਾਅ ਤੇ ਤਜਰਬੇ ਦਿਮਾਗ ਨੂੰ ਚਿੰਤਿਤ ਕਰ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨ ਇਹ ਵੀ ਸਿੱਖਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਕਿਵੇਂ ਸਿੱਖਦਾ ਹੈ—ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਅਨੁਭਵਾਂ ਦੁਆਰਾ, ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਦੁਹਰਾਈ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਅਤੇ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਹੋਰ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਦੇਖ ਕੇ। ਬੱਚੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਮਾਪਿਆਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਆਦਤਾਂ ਕਿਉਂ ਅਪਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਇਸਦਾ ਸਿੱਧਾ ਜਵਾਬ ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਦੇਖਣ ਅਤੇ ਨਕਲ ਕਰਨ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਸਿੱਖਦੇ ਹਨ। ਜਿਵੇਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਅਨੁਭਵ ਵਧਦੇ ਹਨ, ਉਸਦੀ ਸੋਚਣ ਦੀ ਸਮਰੱਥਾ ਅਤੇ ਫੈਸਲੇ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਯੋਗਤਾ ਵੀ ਬਦਲਦੀ ਹੈ। ਅਜੋਕੇ ਯੁੱਗ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਣਾਅ, ਚਿੰਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਡਰ ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨਕ ਚੁਣੌਤੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡਾ ਸਰੋਤ ਬਣ ਗਏ ਹਨ। ਲੰਬੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਦਾ ਤਣਾਅ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਸਿਹਤ ਨੂੰ ਇੰਨਾ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਯਾਦਦਾਸ਼ਤ, ਧਿਆਨ, ਰਿਸ਼ਤੇ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਰੱਥਾ ਤੱਕ ਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਿਤ ਕਰ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਮਹਾਰਾਜਾ ਰਣਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਦੇ ਰਾਜ ਦੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਇਹ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਉਸ ਦੌਰ ਦੀ ਹੈ ਜਦੋਂ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਆਪਣੀ ਤਾਕਤ, ਏਕਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਸਵੈਮਾਨ ਲਈ ਜਾਣਿਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਸੀ। ਲਾਹੌਰ ਦੀ ਗੱਦੀ ਉੱਤੇ ਬੈਠੇ ਮਹਾਰਾਜਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਸ਼ਾਸਕ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਨ ਸਗੋਂ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਲਈ ਇਨਸਾਫ਼ ਅਤੇ ਧਰਮਨਿਰਪੇਖਤਾ ਦੀ ਮਿਸਾਲ ਸਨ। ਉਹ ਹਰ ਧਰਮ ਅਤੇ ਹਰ ਵਰਗ ਦੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕੋ ਨਜ਼ਰ ਨਾਲ ਵੇਖਦੇ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਇਸੀ ਸੋਚ ਨੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਰਾਜ ਨੂੰ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਬਣਾਇਆ। ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਕਸ਼ਮੀਰ ਦੇ ਇਲਾਕੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਸਥਾਨਕ ਜਾਗੀਰਦਾਰ ਨੇ ਗਰੀਬ ਕਿਸਾਨਾਂ ਉੱਤੇ ਬੇਵਜ੍ਹਾ ਟੈਕਸ ਲਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਜਿਸ ਕਾਰਨ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੇਚੈਨੀ ਫੈਲ ਗਈ। ਕਿਸਾਨਾਂ ਨੇ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਆਪਣੀ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਸਥਾਨਕ ਅਧਿਕਾਰੀਆਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਈ ਪਰ ਕਿਸੇ ਨੇ ਵੀ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੁਣਵਾਈ ਨਾ ਕੀਤੀ। ਆਖਿਰਕਾਰ ਕੁਝ ਹਿੰਮਤੀ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਲਾਹੌਰ ਪਹੁੰਚੇ ਅਤੇ ਮਹਾਰਾਜਾ ਰਣਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਦੇ ਦਰਬਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਪਣੀ ਗੱਲ ਰੱਖੀ? ਦਰਬਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਾਰੇ ਸਰਦਾਰ ਮੌਜੂਦ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਮਾਹੌਲ ਗੰਭੀਰ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਮਹਾਰਾਜਾ ਨੇ ਧੀਰਜ ਨਾਲ ਕਿਸਾਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਗੱਲ ਸੁਣੀ ਅਤੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਭਰੋਸਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਕਿ ਇਨਸਾਫ਼ ਜ਼ਰੂਰ ਮਿਲੇਗਾ। ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਤੁਰੰਤ ਇੱਕ ਜਾਂਚ ਕਮੇਟੀ ਬਣਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਉਸ ਜਾਗੀਰਦਾਰ ਨੂੰ ਦਰਬਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਹਾਜ਼ਰ ਹੋਣ ਦਾ ਹੁਕਮ ਦਿੱਤਾ। ਜਾਂਚ ਵਿੱਚ ਸੱਚ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਆ ਗਿਆ ਕਿ ਜਾਗੀਰਦਾਰ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਦਾ ਗਲਤ ਇਸਤੇਮਾਲ ਕੀਤਾ ਸੀ। ਮਹਾਰਾਜਾ ਨੇ ਨਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਉਹ ਟੈਕਸ ਰੱਦ ਕਰ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਸਗੋਂ ਜਾਗੀਰਦਾਰ; ਨੂੰ ਸਖ਼ਤ ਸਜ਼ਾ ਵੀ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਤਾਂ ਜੋ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਜ਼ੁਲਮ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਹਿੰਮਤ ਨਾ ਕਰੇ। ਇਸ ਫੈਸਲੇ ਨਾਲ ਕਿਸਾਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਚਿਹਰਿਆਂ ਉੱਤੇ ਮੁਸਕਾਨ ਆ ਗਈ ਅਤੇ ਸਾਰੇ ਰਾਜ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਹ ਸੁਨੇਹਾ ਫੈਲ ਗਿਆ ਕਿ ਲਾਹੌਰ ਦੀ ਗੱਦੀ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਸੱਚ ਅਤੇ ਇਨਸਾਫ਼ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਖੜੀ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਘਟਨਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਉਸ ਯੁੱਗ ਦੀ ਸੋਚ ਨੂੰ ਦਰਸਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਜਦੋਂ ਰਾਜ ਦੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਭਲਾਈ ਲਈ ਵਰਤੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਸੀ। ਮਹਾਰਾਜਾ ਰਣਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਅੱਜ ਵੀ ਇਸ ਲਈ ਯਾਦ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਦਿਖਾਇਆ ਕਿ ਸੱਚਾ ਸ਼ਾਸਕ ਉਹ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਤਲਵਾਰ ਨਾਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਨਿਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਦਇਆ ਨਾਲ ਰਾਜ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਫੈਸਲੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਦੇ ਦੁੱਖ ਸੁੱਖ ਨਾਲ ਜੁੜੇ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਹਰ ਵਰਗ ਨੂੰ ਇਨਸਾਫ ਮਿਲਦਾ ਸੀ। ਇਸੇ ਕਾਰਨ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਰਾਜ ਭਰੋਸੇ ਅਤੇ ਸਾਂਝ ਦੀ ਮਿਸਾਲ ਬਣਿਆ ਜੋ ਅੱਜ ਵੀ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਣਾ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਦਿਵਸ ਭਾਰਤ ਦੇ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਦਾ ਉਹ ਸੁਨਹਿਰਾ ਦਿਨ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਹਰ ਸਾਲ ੨੬ ਜਨਵਰੀ ਨੂੰ ਪੂਰੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੜੇ ਮਾਣ, ਉਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਅਤੇ ਦੇਸ਼ਭਗਤੀ ਦੀ ਭਾਵਨਾ ਨਾਲ ਮਨਾਇਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਸੇ ਦਿਨ ੧੯੫੦ ਵਿੱਚ ਭਾਰਤ ਦਾ ਸੰਵਿਧਾਨ ਲਾਗੂ ਹੋਇਆ ਅਤੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਨੇ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਕ ਤੌਰ ਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਸੰਪੂਰਨ ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਘੋਸ਼ਿਤ ਕੀਤਾ। ਇਸ ਦਿਨ ਨਾਲ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਕਾਨੂੰਨੀ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਨਹੀਂ ਜੁੜੀ ਹੋਈ ਸਗੋਂ ਉਹ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼, ਕੁਰਬਾਨੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਸੁਪਨੇ ਵੀ ਜੁੜੇ ਹਨ ਜੋ ਅਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਦੇ ਸੈਨਾਨੀਆਂ ਨੇ ਇੱਕ ਨਿਆਂਪ੍ਰਧਾਨ ਅਤੇ ਲੋਕਤੰਤਰਕ ਭਾਰਤ ਦੀ ਨੀਂਹ ਰੱਖਣ ਲਈ ਵੇਖੇ ਸਨ। ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਦਿਵਸ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਇਹ ਯਾਦ ਦਿਵਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਮਿਲਣ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਚੁਣੌਤੀ ਦੇਸ਼ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਵਿਧਾਨ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਚਲਾਉਣ ਦੀ ਸੀ ਤਾਂ ਜੋ ਹਰ ਨਾਗਰਿਕ ਨੂੰ ਬਰਾਬਰੀ, ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਅਤੇ ਨਿਆਂ ਮਿਲ ਸਕੇ। ਭਾਰਤੀ ਸੰਵਿਧਾਨ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਦਾ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡਾ ਲਿਖਤ ਸੰਵਿਧਾਨ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਹਰ ਧਰਮ, ਜਾਤੀ, ਭਾਸ਼ਾ ਅਤੇ ਵਰਗ ਦੇ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕੋ ਅਧਿਕਾਰ ਅਤੇ ਇੱਕੋ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰੀ ਦੇ ਅਧੀਨ ਲਿਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਦਿਵਸ ਮੌਕੇ ਦਿੱਲੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੋਣ ਵਾਲੀ ਸ਼ਾਨਦਾਰ ਪਰੇਡ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਤਾਕਤ ਦਾ ਪ੍ਰਦਰਸ਼ਨ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਸੱਭਿਆਚਾਰਕ ਵਿਭਿੰਨਤਾ, ਇਕਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ ਦੀ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਕ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਹਰ ਰਾਜ ਆਪਣੀ ਵਿਲੱਖਣ ਵਿਰਾਸਤ ਨੂੰ ਝਾਂਕੀਆਂ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਪੇਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਸੈਨਾ ਦੀ ਪਰੇਡ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਸੁਰੱਖਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਤੀ ਸਮਰਪਣ ਨੂੰ ਦਰਸਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਦਿਨ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਨੌਜਵਾਨਾਂ ਲਈ ਖਾਸ ਮਹੱਤਵ ਰੱਖਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਸਕੂਲਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਕਾਲਜਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੋਣ ਵਾਲੇ ਸਮਾਰੋਹ ਨਵੀਂ ਪੀੜ੍ਹੀ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਵਿਧਾਨ ਦੇ ਮੁੱਲਾਂ, ਦੇਸ਼ਭਗਤੀ ਅਤੇ ਨਾਗਰਿਕ ਫ਼ਰਜ਼ਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਜਾਗਰੂਕ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਦਿਵਸ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਆਪਣੇ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਯਾਦ ਨਹੀਂ ਦਿਵਾਉਂਦਾ ਸਗੋਂ ਇਹ ਵੀ ਸਮਝਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਫ਼ਰਜ਼ਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਅਧਿਕਾਰ ਅਧੂਰੇ ਹਨ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਜਦੋਂ ਹਰ ਨਾਗਰਿਕ ਇਮਾਨਦਾਰੀ ਨਾਲ ਆਪਣੇ ਕਰਤਵਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਨਿਭਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਦ ਹੀ ਲੋਕਤੰਤਰ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਅੱਜ ਦੇ ਦੌਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਦੋਂ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਵੰਡ, ਅਸਹਿਣਸ਼ੀਲਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਨੈਤਿਕ ਮੁੱਲਾਂ ਦੀ ਕਮੀ ਵਰਗੀਆਂ ਚੁਣੌਤੀਆਂ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਹਨ, ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਦਿਵਸ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਇਕਤਾ, ਸਹਿਣਸ਼ੀਲਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਵਿਧਾਨ ਪ੍ਰਤੀ ਨਿਸ਼ਠਾ ਦਾ ਸੰਦੇਸ਼ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਦਿਨ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਤਿਰੰਗਾ ਲਹਿਰਾਉਣ ਜਾਂ ਛੁੱਟੀ ਮਨਾਉਣ ਦਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਅੰਦਰ ਦੇ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰ ਨਾਗਰਿਕ ਨੂੰ ਜਗਾਉਣ ਦਾ ਦਿਨ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਜੋ ਅਸੀਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਲਈ ਸੱਚਾਈ, ਇਮਾਨਦਾਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਰਪਣ ਨਾਲ ਕੰਮ ਕਰੀਏ ਅਤੇ ਭਾਰਤ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ, ਨਿਆਂਪ੍ਰਧਾਨ, ਇਕਤਾਬੱਧ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਗਟਿਸੀਲ ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਬਣਾਈ ਰੱਖੀਏ।

ਬਰਸਾਤ ਦਾ ਮੌਸਮ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਦੀ ਉਹ ਅਨਮੋਲ ਦਾਤ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਗਰਮੀ ਦੀ ਤਪਸ਼ ਅਤੇ ਸੁੱਕੇਪਣ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਧਰਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਨਵਾਂ ਜੀਵਨ ਬਖ਼ਸ਼ਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਮਨ ਨੂੰ ਤਾਜ਼ਗੀ, ਸ਼ਾਂਤੀ ਅਤੇ ਸੁਕੂਨ ਨਾਲ ਭਰ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਦੋਂ ਆਕਾਸ਼ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਾਲੇ ਘਣੇ ਬੱਦਲ ਛਾ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਠੰਢੀ ਹਵਾ ਦੇ ਝੋਕੇ ਚੱਲਣ ਲੱਗ ਪੈਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਤਾਂ ਮੌਸਮ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਅਲੱਗ ਹੀ ਰਮਣੀਕਤਾ ਆ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਧਰਤੀ ਦੀ ਸੁੱਕੀ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਤੋਂ ਉੱਠਦੀ ਮਿੱਠੀ ਮਹਿਕ ਹਰ ਦਿਲ ਨੂੰ ਖੁਸ਼ ਕਰ ਦਿੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਮੀਂਹ ਦੀ ਪਹਿਲੀ ਬੂੰਦ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਲਈ ਆਸ, ਭਰੋਸੇ ਅਤੇ ਖੁਸ਼ਹਾਲੀ ਦੀ ਨਿਸ਼ਾਨੀ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਹ ਮੌਸਮ ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਲਈ ਵਰਦਾਨ ਸਾਬਤ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਸੁੱਕੇ ਖੇਤਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਹਰੇ ਭਰੇ ਕਰ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਬਰਸਾਤ ਨਾਲ ਦਰਿਆ, ਨਾਲੇ, ਤਲਾਬ ਅਤੇ ਝੀਲਾਂ ਭਰ ਜਾਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਪਾਣੀ ਦੀ ਘਾਟ ਦੂਰ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਦੀ ਉਪਜਾਊ ਸ਼ਕਤੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਾਧਾ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਪਿੰਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਾਨਸੂਨ ਦਾ ਮੌਸਮ ਖਾਸ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਅਤੇ ਰੌਣਕ ਲਿਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਬਿਜਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਖੇਤੀ ਦੇ ਕੰਮ ਵਿੱਚ ਜੋਸ਼ ਨਾਲ ਲੱਗ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਬੱਚੇ ਮੀਂਹ ਦੀਆਂ ਬੂੰਦਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਖੇਡ ਕੇ ਖੁਸ਼ੀ ਮਹਿਸੂਸ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਸ਼ਹਿਰਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਮੀਂਹ ਗਰਮੀ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਰਾਹਤ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਕਈ ਵਾਰ ਸੜਕਾਂ ਉੱਤੇ ਪਾਣੀ ਭਰ ਜਾਣਾ, ਟ੍ਰੈਫਿਕ ਦੀ ਸਮੱਸਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਦਫ਼ਤਰੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਰੁਕਾਵਟਾਂ ਪੈਦਾ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਜੋ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਸੁਚੱਜੀ ਯੋਜਨਾ ਅਤੇ ਬਿਹਤਰ ਪ੍ਰਬੰਧਨ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਵੱਲ ਧਿਆਨ ਦਿਵਾਉਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਬਰਸਾਤ ਦਾ ਮੌਸਮ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸੁਹਾਵਣਾ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਸਗੋਂ ਸਾਵਧਾਨੀ ਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਵੀ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਸ ਦੌਰਾਨ ਮੱਛਰਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਗੰਦਗੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਕਈ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਫੈਲ ਸਕਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਸਫ਼ਾਈ ਤੇ ਸਿਹਤ ਦਾ ਖ਼ਾਸ ਧਿਆਨ ਰੱਖਣਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਕੁਦਰਤ ਇਸ ਮੌਸਮ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਪਣੀ ਪੂਰੀ ਸੋਭਾ ਵਿਖਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਜਦੋਂ ਦਰੱਖ਼ਤ ਨਵੇਂ ਹਰੇ ਪੱਤਿਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਢੱਕ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਫੁੱਲ ਖਿੜ ਉੱਠਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਪੰਛੀ ਆਪਣੀ ਚਹਚਹਾਹਟ ਨਾਲ ਮਾਹੌਲ ਨੂੰ ਜੀਵੰਤ ਬਣਾ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਮਾਨਸੂਨ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਨਾਲ ਨਜ਼ਦੀਕ ਲਿਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਅਹਿਸਾਸ ਕਰਵਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਦੇ ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਸੁਚੱਜਾ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਨਾਲ ਚੱਲ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮੀਂਹ ਦੀ ਰਿਮਝਿਮ ਮਨ ਨੂੰ ਸ਼ਾਂਤ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਥਕਾਵਟ ਭਰੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਨਵੀਂ ਉਰਜਾ ਭਰ ਦਿੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਅਖ਼ੀਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਹਿ ਸਕੀਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਬਰਸਾਤ ਅਤੇ ਮਾਨਸੂਨ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਮੌਸਮ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਜੀਵਨ ਦਾ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਕ ਹਨ ਜੋ ਹਰ ਸੁੱਕੇ ਪਲ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਨਵੀਂ ਆਸ, ਤਾਜ਼ਗੀ ਅਤੇ ਨਵੀਂ ਸ਼ੁਰੂਆਤ ਦਾ ਸੁਨੇਹਾ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ

ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਣਾਲੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ ਦੀ ਭੂਮਿਕਾ ਦਿਨੋਂ ਦਿਨ ਵਧਦੀ ਜਾ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਇਸ ਨੇ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਦੇ ਤਰੀਕਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਪੂਰੀ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਬਦਲ ਕੇ ਰੱਖ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਹੁਣ ਗਿਆਨ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਕਿਤਾਬਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਸੀਮਿਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹਿਆ ਸਗੋਂ ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਮਾਧਿਅਮਾਂ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਹਰ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਦੀ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਵਿੱਚ ਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ। ਆਨਲਾਈਨ ਕਲਾਸਾਂ, ਵਰਚੁਅਲ ਲੈਬੋਰਟਰੀਆਂ, ਈ ਲਰਨਿੰਗ ਪਲੇਟਫਾਰਮ ਅਤੇ ਇੰਟਰਐਕਟਿਵ ਐਪਲੀਕੇਸ਼ਨਾਂ ਨੇ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਦੀ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਨੂੰ ਹੋਰ ਵੀ ਦਿਲਚਸਪ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਸ਼ਾਲੀ ਬਣਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਆਪਣੀ ਰਫ਼ਤਾਰ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਪੜ੍ਹ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ। ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀਕਲ ਸਾਧਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਦਦ ਨਾਲ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਵੀ ਵਿਸ਼ਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਸਾਨ ਉਦਾਹਰਨਾਂ, ਵਿਜ਼ੁਅਲ ਪ੍ਰਜ਼ੈਂਟੇਸ਼ਨਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰਯੋਗਾਤਮਕ ਗਤਿਵਿਧੀਆਂ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਸਮਝਾ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਪਾਠਕ੍ਰਮ ਦੀ ਸਮਝ ਹੋਰ ਗਹਿਰੀ ਬਣਦੀ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਨਾਲ ਰਿਕਾਰਡ ਕੀਤੀਆਂ ਲੈਕਚਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੁਵਿਧਾ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਦੁਬਾਰਾ ਪੜ੍ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਦੇਹ ਦੂਰ ਕਰਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਦਦ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਨੇ ਪਿੰਡਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਦੂਰ ਦਰਾਜ਼ ਖੇਤਰਾਂ ਦੇ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਲਈ ਵੀ ਨਵੇਂ ਮੌਕੇ ਖੋਲ੍ਹੇ ਹਨ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਗੁਣਵੱਤਾ ਵਾਲੀ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਹਰ ਸੀ। ਹਾਲਾਂਕਿ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ ਨੇ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਨੂੰ ਸੁਲਭ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਇਸਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਨਾਲ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ, ਧਿਆਨ ਅਤੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੇ ਸਹੀ ਪ੍ਰਬੰਧਨ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਵੀ ਵਧ ਗਈ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਧਿਆਨ ਭਟਕਾਉਣ ਵਾਲੇ ਤੱਤ ਵੀ ਆਸਾਨੀ ਨਾਲ ਉਪਲਬਧ ਹਨ। ਲੰਬੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਤੱਕ ਸਕ੍ਰੀਨ ਦੇ ਸਾਹਮਣੇ ਬੈਠਣ ਨਾਲ ਸਿਹਤ ਸੰਬੰਧੀ ਸਮੱਸਿਆਵਾਂ ਵੀ ਪੈਦਾ ਹੋ ਸਕਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ ਜਿਸ ਲਈ ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਬਣਾਈ ਰੱਖਣਾ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਲਈ ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਨੈਤਿਕ ਮੁੱਲਾਂ, ਆਤਮਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਦੀ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੇਣਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੈ। ਮਾਪਿਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਅਧਿਆਪਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਸਾਂਝੀ ਭੂਮਿਕਾ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਹੀ ਦਿਸ਼ਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ ਵਰਤਣ ਲਈ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਿਤ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੀ ਹੈ। ਜਦੋਂ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ ਅਤੇ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਾ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਮਿਲਾਪ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਨਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਅਕਾਦਮਿਕ ਤੌਰ ਤੇ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਬਣਦੇ ਹਨ ਸਗੋਂ ਸਮੱਸਿਆ ਹੱਲ ਕਰਨ, ਰਚਨਾਤਮਕ ਸੋਚ ਅਤੇ ਆਤਮਨਿਰਭਰਤਾ ਵਰਗੀਆਂ ਕੁਸ਼ਲਤਾਵਾਂ ਵੀ ਵਿਕਸਿਤ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਸ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਯੁੱਗ ਵਿੱਚ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀਕਲ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਨੂੰ ਸਮਝਦਾਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰੀ ਨਾਲ ਅਪਣਾਉਣਾ ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਲੋੜ ਬਣ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ।

ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਵਿਅਕਤਿਤਵ ਦਾ ਉਹ ਅਹੰਕਾਰਪੂਰਕ ਅੰਗ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਪਹਿਚਾਣ, ਯੋਗਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਮਹੱਤਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਸਮਝਣ ਦੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਹਰ ਖੇਤਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਉਸਦੇ ਵਿਹਾਰ ਅਤੇ ਫ਼ੈਸਲਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਿਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਦੋਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨੂੰ ਸਵੀਕਾਰ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੀਆਂ ਤਾਕਤਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰੀਆਂ ਦੋਵੇਂ ਨੂੰ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਢੰਗ ਨਾਲ ਸਮਝਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਉਸਦਾ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਬਣਦਾ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਲ ਹਾਲਾਤਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਡਟ ਕੇ ਖੜ੍ਹਾ ਰਹਿਣ ਦੀ ਸਮਰਥਾ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉੱਚ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਵਾਲਾ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਅਸਫ਼ਲਤਾ ਤੋਂ ਘਬਰਾਉਂਦਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਦਾ ਮੌਕਾ ਸਮਝਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਉੱਤੇ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਬਣਾਈ ਰੱਖਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਸਦੇ ਉਲਟ ਘੱਟ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਉੱਤੇ ਸ਼ੱਕ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਮਜਬੂਰ ਕਰ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਉਹ ਮੌਕੇ ਹੋਣ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ ਵੀ ਅੱਗੇ ਵਧਣ ਤੋਂ ਡਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਪਰਿਵਾਰਕ ਮਾਹੌਲ, ਸਿੱਖਿਆ, ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਤਜਰਬੇ ਅਤੇ ਬਚਪਨ ਦੇ ਅਨੁਭਵ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਦੀ ਨਿਰਮਾਣ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਭੂਮਿਕਾ ਨਿਭਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਸਾਰਾਹਨਾ ਅਤੇ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਣਾ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਦੀ ਕਦਰ ਕਰਨਾ ਸਿਖਾਉਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ। ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਦਾ ਅਰਥ ਅਹੰਕਾਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨਾਲ ਸਤਿਕਾਰਪੂਰਕ ਅਤੇ ਸਕਾਰਾਤਮਕ ਸੰਬੰਧ ਬਣਾਈ ਰੱਖਣਾ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਦੂਜਿਆਂ ਦਾ ਵੀ ਆਦਰ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਦੋਂ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਆਪਣੇ ਲਕਸ਼ਾਂ ਵੱਲ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਛੋਟੀਆਂ ਛੋਟੀਆਂ ਸਫਲਤਾਵਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਮਾਨ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਉਸਦਾ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਹੌਲੀ ਹੌਲੀ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਵਿਕਸਿਤ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨਾਲ ਨਕਾਰਾਤਮਕ ਗੱਲਬਾਤ ਤੋਂ ਬਚਣਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਅੰਦਰੂਨੀ ਸੋਚ ਮਨ ਦੀ ਦਿਸ਼ਾ ਨਿਰਧਾਰਤ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਸਿਹਤਮੰਦ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਵਾਲਾ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਆਲੋਚਨਾ ਨੂੰ ਅਪਮਾਨ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਸੁਧਾਰ ਦੇ ਮੌਕੇ ਵਜੋਂ ਸਵੀਕਾਰ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਸਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਆਪਣੀਆਂ ਹੱਦਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਮਝਣਾ ਅਤੇ ਜ਼ਰੂਰਤ ਪੈਣ ਤੇ ਨਾ ਕਹਿਣਾ ਵੀ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਦੀ ਨਿਸ਼ਾਨੀ ਹੈ। ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਦੂਜਿਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਤੁਲਨਾ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਥਾਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਉੱਤੇ ਧਿਆਨ ਕੇਂਦਰਿਤ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਿਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਦੋਂ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਮੁੱਲਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਅਸੂਲਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਸੱਚਾ ਰਹਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਉਸਦੀ ਅੰਦਰੂਨੀ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤੀ ਵਧਦੀ ਹੈ। ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਭਾਵਨਾਤਮਕ ਤੌਰ ਤੇ ਸੰਤੁਲਿਤ ਬਣਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਤਣਾਅ ਅਤੇ ਡਰ ਘੱਟ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਸ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਆਤਮਸਨਮਾਨ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨਿਕ ਧਾਰਣਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਇੱਕ ਐਸੀ ਅੰਦਰੂਨੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਆਤਮਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ, ਸੰਤੁਲਨ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਤੁਸ਼ਟੀ ਭਰਿਆ ਜੀਵਨ ਜੀਣ ਲਈ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਿਤ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ।

ਭਾਰਤ ਦੀ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਯਾਤਰਾ ਇੱਕ ਐਸੀ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼, ਸੰਭਾਵਨਾਵਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਲਗਾਤਾਰ ਅੱਗੇ ਵਧਣ ਦੀ ਦ੍ਰਿੜ ਇੱਛਾ ਨਾਲ ਭਰੀ ਹੋਈ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਜਿਸਨੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਨੂੰ ਵਿਸ਼ਵ ਪੱਧਰ ਤੇ ਇੱਕ ਉਭਰਦੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਵਜੋਂ ਸਥਾਪਿਤ ਕੀਤਾ ਹੈ। ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਭਾਰਤ ਨੇ ਅਨੇਕਾਂ ਆਰਥਿਕ, ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਅਤੇ ਰਾਜਨੀਤਿਕ ਚੁਣੌਤੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਸਾਹਮਣਾ ਕੀਤਾ ਪਰ ਹੌਲੀ ਹੌਲੀ ਯੋਜਨਾਬੱਧ ਵਿਕਾਸ, ਲੋਕਤੰਤਰਿਕ ਪ੍ਰਣਾਲੀ ਅਤੇ ਨੀਤੀਗਤ ਸੁਧਾਰਾਂ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਅੱਗੇ ਵਧਦਾ ਗਿਆ। ੧੯੯੦ ਦੇ ਦਹਾਕੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਰਥਿਕ ਉਦਾਰੀਕਰਨ ਨੇ ਭਾਰਤੀ ਅਰਥਵਿਵਸਥਾ ਨੂੰ ਨਵੀਂ ਦਿਸ਼ਾ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਨਿੱਜੀ ਖੇਤਰ ਨੂੰ ਮੌਕੇ ਮਿਲੇ, ਵਿਦੇਸ਼ੀ ਨਿਵੇਸ਼ ਵਧਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਉਦਯੋਗਿਕ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਨੂੰ ਗਤੀ ਮਿਲੀ। ਇਸ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਸੂਚਨਾ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ, ਸਾਫਟਵੇਅਰ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ, ਫਾਰਮਾ, ਟੈਕਸਟਾਈਲ ਅਤੇ ਆਟੋਮੋਬਾਈਲ ਉਦਯੋਗਾਂ ਨੇ ਭਾਰਤ ਨੂੰ ਵਿਸ਼ਵ ਮਾਰਕੀਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਪਹਿਚਾਣ ਦਿਵਾਈ। ਭਾਰਤ ਦੀ ਵੱਡੀ ਅਤੇ ਨੌਜਵਾਨ ਆਬਾਦੀ ਇਸਦੀ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਇੱਕ ਪਾਸੇ ਮਿਹਨਤੀ ਕਾਰਜਸ਼ਕਤੀ ਮੁਹੱਈਆ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਦੂਜੇ ਪਾਸੇ ਉਪਭੋਗਤਾ ਬਾਜ਼ਾਰ ਨੂੰ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤੀ ਦਿੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਅਜੇ ਵੀ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਅਰਥਵਿਵਸਥਾ ਦੀ ਰੀੜ੍ਹ ਦੀ ਹੱਡੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਤਕਨੀਕਾਂ, ਸਿੰਚਾਈ ਯੋਜਨਾਵਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਕਿਸਾਨ ਕਲਿਆਣ ਨੀਤੀਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਇਸ ਖੇਤਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਸੁਧਾਰ ਆ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਭਾਰਤ, ਸਟਾਰਟਅਪ ਸਭਿਆਚਾਰ ਅਤੇ ਨਵੀਨਤਾ ਨੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਨੂੰ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀਕਲ ਤੌਰ ਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਹੈ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਆਨਲਾਈਨ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ, ਡਿਜ਼ਿਟਲ ਭੁਗਤਾਨ ਅਤੇ ਈ ਗਵਰਨੈਂਸ ਨੇ ਆਮ ਨਾਗਰਿਕ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਆਸਾਨ ਬਣਾਈ ਹੈ। ਬੁਨਿਆਦੀ ਢਾਂਚੇ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਸੜਕਾਂ, ਰੇਲਵੇ, ਮੈਟਰੋ, ਹਵਾਈ ਅੱਡੇ ਅਤੇ ਬੰਦਰਗਾਹਾਂ ਦੇ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਨਾਲ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੇ ਅੰਦਰ ਅਤੇ ਬਾਹਰ ਵਪਾਰ ਨੂੰ ਨਵੀਂ ਗਤੀ ਮਿਲੀ ਹੈ। ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਹੁਨਰ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਉੱਤੇ ਵਧਦਾ ਧਿਆਨ ਨੌਜਵਾਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਰੋਜ਼ਗਾਰਯੋਗ ਬਣਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਉਤਪਾਦਕਤਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਾਧਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਹਾਲਾਂਕਿ ਗਰੀਬੀ, ਬੇਰੋਜ਼ਗਾਰੀ, ਅਸਮਾਨਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਵਾਤਾਵਰਣ ਸੰਬੰਧੀ ਸਮੱਸਿਆਵਾਂ ਵਰਗੀਆਂ ਚੁਣੌਤੀਆਂ ਅਜੇ ਵੀ ਮੌਜੂਦ ਹਨ ਪਰ ਨੀਤੀਆਂ, ਲੋਕ ਭਾਗੀਦਾਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਜਾਗਰੂਕਤਾ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਹੱਲ ਲੱਭਿਆ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਭਾਰਤ ਦਾ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਆਰਥਿਕ ਅੰਕੜਿਆਂ ਤੱਕ ਸੀਮਿਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਸਗੋਂ ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਤਰੱਕੀ, ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀਕਲ ਉੱਚਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਸ਼ਵ ਪੱਧਰ ਤੇ ਵਧਦੀ ਭੂਮਿਕਾ ਨਾਲ ਜੁੜਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਦਰਸਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਭਾਰਤ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਵਿਕਾਸ, ਨਵੀਨਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਸਮਾਵੇਸ਼ੀ ਤਰੱਕੀ ਦੇ ਰਾਹ ਤੇ ਅਡਿੱਗ ਰਹੇਗਾ।

ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੇ ਇੱਕ ਛੋਟੇ ਜਿਹੇ ਪਿੰਡ ਸਰਸਾਈ ਵਿੱਚ ਰਹਿਣ ਵਾਲਾ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਇੱਕ ਸਾਦਾ ਤੇ ਮਿਹਨਤੀ ਨੌਜਵਾਨ ਸੀ। ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਮਾਪਿਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਖੇਤੀਬਾੜੀ ਕਰਦਾ ਸੀ ਅਤੇ ਹਰ ਰੋਜ਼ ਸਵੇਰੇ ਉੱਠ ਕੇ ਖੇਤਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦਾ। ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਦੀ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਡੀ ਖਾਸੀਅਤ ਉਸਦੀ ਸੱਚਾਈ ਅਤੇ ਇਮਾਨਦਾਰੀ ਸੀ ਪਿੰਡ ਦੇ ਲੋਕ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਬਹੁਤ ਮਾਣ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਹ ਕਿਸੇ ਨਾਲ ਧੋਖਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰਦਾ ਸੀ ਅਤੇ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਸੱਚ ਦਾ ਸਾਥ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਸੀ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡਾ ਜਮੀਨਦਾਰ ਸੀ ਜਿਸਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਬਲਵੰਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਸੀ। ਉਹ ਬਹੁਤ ਅਮੀਰ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਉਸਦਾ ਦਿਲ ਬਿਲਕੁਲ ਵੀ ਸਾਫ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ ਉਹ ਅਕਸਰ ਗਰੀਬ ਕਿਸਾਨਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਧੋਖਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਅਤੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀ ਜਮੀਨ ਹੜਪਣ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਉਸਦੀ ਨਜ਼ਰ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਤੇ ਵੀ ਸੀ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਹ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਬਹੁਤ ਉਪਜਾਊ ਸੀ ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਬਲਵੰਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਘਰ ਬੁਲਾਇਆ ਅਤੇ ਕਿਹਾ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਉਸਦੀ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਖਰੀਦਣਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉਸਨੇ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੂੰ ਘੱਟ ਪੈਸੇ ਦੀ ਪੇਸ਼ਕਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੇ ਨਰਮ ਪਰ ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ ਸੁਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਿਹਾ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੀ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਨਹੀਂ ਵੇਚੇਗਾ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਹ ਉਸਦੇ ਪੂਰਵਜਾਂ ਦੀ ਨਿਸ਼ਾਨੀ ਹੈ ਬਲਵੰਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੂੰ ਇਹ ਗੱਲ ਬਿਲਕੁਲ ਪਸੰਦ ਨਹੀਂ ਆਈ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਨੇ ਮਨ ਹੀ ਮਨ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੂੰ ਸਬਕ ਸਿਖਾਉਣ ਦੀ ਠਾਨ ਲੀ ਕੁਝ ਦਿਨਾਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਝੂਠੀ ਅਫ਼ਵਾਹ ਫੈਲਾਈ ਗਈ ਕਿ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੇ ਸਰਕਾਰੀ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਤੇ ਕਬਜ਼ਾ ਕੀਤਾ ਹੈ ਇਹ ਅਫ਼ਵਾਹ ਬਲਵੰਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਦਮੀਆਂ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਫੈਲਵਾਈ ਸੀ। ਸਰਕਾਰੀ ਅਧਿਕਾਰੀ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਆ ਗਏ ਅਤੇ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੂੰ ਪੁੱਛਗਿੱਛ ਲਈ ਬੁਲਾਇਆ ਗਿਆ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਹੈਰਾਨ ਸੀ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਸਨੇ ਕਦੇ ਵੀ ਗਲਤ ਕੰਮ ਨਹੀਂ ਕੀਤਾ ਸੀ। ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਸਾਰੇ ਕਾਗਜ਼ਾਤ ਅਧਿਕਾਰੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਦਿਖਾਏ ਉਸਦੇ ਕੋਲ ਸਹੀ ਰਜਿਸਟਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਪਟਵਾਰੀ ਦੇ ਦਸਤਾਵੇਜ਼ ਸਨ ਜੋ ਸਾਬਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਸਨ ਕਿ ਜ਼ਮੀਨ ਉਸਦੀ ਹੀ ਹੈ ਪਰ ਬਲਵੰਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਕੁਝ ਨਕਲੀ ਕਾਗਜ਼ ਤਿਆਰ ਕਰਵਾ ਲਏ ਸਨ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਮਾਮਲਾ ਗੁੰਝਲਦਾਰ ਬਣ ਗਿਆ। ਪਿੰਡ ਦੇ ਲੋਕ ਵੀ ਦੋ ਭਾਗਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੰਡ ਗਏ। ਕੁਝ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਦੇ ਹੱਕ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਕੁਝ ਡਰ ਕਰਕੇ ਬਲਵੰਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਦਾ ਪੱਖ ਲੈ ਰਹੇ ਸਨ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਦੇ ਮਾਪਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਬਹੁਤ ਦੁੱਖ ਹੋਇਆ ਪਰ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਪੁੱਤਰ ਨੂੰ ਹੌਸਲਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਕਿ ਸੱਚਾਈ ਕਦੇ ਹਾਰਦੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਅਮਰਜੀਤ ਨੇ ਫੈਸਲਾ ਕੀਤਾ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਅਦਾਲਤ ਦਾ ਦਰਵਾਜਾ ਖਟਖਟਾਏਗਾ। ਉਸਨੇ ਇੱਕ ਇਮਾਨਦਾਰ ਵਕੀਲ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਪਰਕ ਕੀਤਾ ਜੋ ਗਰੀਬਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਦਦ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਮਸ਼ਹੂਰ ਸੀ।

ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੀ ਪਵਿੱਤਰ ਧਰਤੀ ਨੇ ਅਨੇਕਾਂ ਮਹਾਨ ਸੂਰਮੇ ਜਨਮ ਦਿੱਤੇ ਹਨ ਪਰ ਸਰਦਾਰ ਭਗਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਦਾ ਲਈ ਸੋਨੇ ਦੇ ਅੱਖਰਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਲਿਖਿਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ। ਉਹ ੨੮ ਸਤੰਬਰ ੧੯੦੭ ਨੂੰ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੇ ਪਿੰਡ ਬੰਗਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਦੇਸ਼ਭਗਤ ਪਰਿਵਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਪੈਦਾ ਹੋਇਆ। ਉਸਦੇ ਪਿਤਾ ਕਿਸ਼ਨ ਸਿੰਘ ਅਤੇ ਚਾਚੇ ਅਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਖੁਦ ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਦੀ ਲਹਿਰ ਨਾਲ ਜੁੜੇ ਹੋਏ ਸਨ ਇਸ ਕਰਕੇ ਭਗਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੂੰ ਬਚਪਨ ਤੋਂ ਹੀ ਦੇਸ਼ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਦੀ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਮਿਲੀ। ਘਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਦੀਆਂ ਗੱਲਾਂ ਕੁਰਬਾਨੀਆਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਕਹਾਣੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਸ਼ਹੀਦਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਯਾਦਾਂ ਉਸਦੇ ਮਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਡੂੰਘੀ ਛਾਪ ਛੱਡ ਗਈਆਂ ਜਦੋਂ ਉਹ ਛੋਟਾ ਸੀ ਤਾਂ ਜਲਿਆਂਵਾਲਾ ਬਾਗ ਕਾਂਡ ਦੀ ਖ਼ਬਰ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਬਹੁਤ ਹਿਲਾ ਕੇ ਰੱਖ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਨੇ ਉਸ ਪਵਿੱਤਰ ਥਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਕੋਲ ਰੱਖ ਲਈ ਤਾਂ ਜੋ ਉਹ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਉਸ ਜ਼ੁਲਮ ਨੂੰ ਯਾਦ ਰੱਖ ਸਕੇ ਨੌਜਵਾਨ ਹੋ ਕੇ ਭਗਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਅੰਗਰੇਜ਼ੀ ਹਕੂਮਤ ਦੀ ਜ਼ੁਲਮ ਭਰੀ ਨੀਤੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਨਜ਼ਦੀਕੋਂ ਸਮਝਿਆ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਦਾ ਮਨ ਬਗਾਵਤ ਨਾਲ ਭਰ ਗਿਆ। ਉਹ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਯੋਧਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ ਸਗੋਂ ਇੱਕ ਸੋਚਵਾਨ ਕ੍ਰਾਂਤੀਕਾਰੀ ਵੀ ਸੀ ਜੋ ਪੜ੍ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਲਿਖਣ ਦਾ ਬਹੁਤ ਸ਼ੌਕੀਨ ਸੀ ਉਸਨੇ ਕਈ ਕਿਤਾਬਾਂ ਪੜ੍ਹੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਨੂੰ ਆਜ਼ਾਦ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਨਵੇਂ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਸੋਚੇ ਜਲਿਆਂਵਾਲਾ ਬਾਗ ਦੀ ਨਿਰਦਈ ਘਟਨਾ ਨੇ ਉਸਦੇ ਦਿਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਅੰਗਰੇਜ਼ੀ ਰਾਜ ਦੇ ਖ਼ਿਲਾਫ਼ ਅੱਗ ਭੜਕਾ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਨੇ ਨਿਰਣਾ ਕਰ ਲਿਆ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਲਈ ਸਮਰਪਿਤ ਕਰੇਗਾ ਭਗਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਸਾਥੀਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਲ ਕੇ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਕਦਮ ਚੁੱਕਿਆ ਜੋ ਸਾਰੀ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਦਾ ਧਿਆਨ ਭਾਰਤ ਵੱਲ ਖਿੱਚ ਸਕੇ ਉਸਨੇ ਕੇਂਦਰੀ ਵਿਧਾਨ ਸਭਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਬੰਬ ਸੁੱਟਿਆ ਪਰ ਉਸਦਾ ਮਕਸਦ ਕਿਸੇ ਨੂੰ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਉਣਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਸੀ ਸਗੋਂ ਸੁੱਤੀ ਹੋਈ ਜਨਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਜਗਾਉਣਾ ਸੀ। ਉਸਨੇ ਜਾਣਬੁੱਝ ਕੇ ਗਿਰਫ਼ਤਾਰੀ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਤਾਂ ਜੋ ਉਹ ਅਦਾਲਤ ਅਤੇ ਜੇਲ੍ਹ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਵਿਚਾਰਾਂ ਦਾ ਮੰਚ ਬਣਾ ਸਕੇ। ਜੇਲ੍ਹ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਉਹ ਡਰਿਆ ਨਹੀਂ ਅਤੇ ਕੈਦੀਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਹੋ ਰਹੇ ਅਨਿਆਇਆਂ ਦੇ ਵਿਰੁੱਧ ਭੁੱਖ ਹੜਤਾਲ ਕਰਕੇ ਆਵਾਜ਼ ਉਠਾਈ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ੨੩ ਮਾਰਚ ੧੯੩੧ ਨੂੰ ਭਗਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਨੂੰ ਫਾਂਸੀ ਦੇ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਗਈ ਪਰ ਉਹ ਸਰੀਰਕ ਤੌਰ ਤੇ ਮਰ ਕੇ ਵੀ ਅਮਰ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ ਉਸਦੀ ਸੋਚ ਉਸਦੀ ਕੁਰਬਾਨੀ ਅਤੇ ਉਸਦਾ ਅਡਿੱਗ ਹੌਸਲਾ ਅੱਜ ਵੀ ਕਰੋੜਾਂ ਨੌਜਵਾਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਿਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਭਗਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਦੀ ਕਹਾਣੀ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਸਿਖਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਸੱਚੀ ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਕੁਰਬਾਨੀ ਮੰਗਦੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਇੱਕ ਜਾਗਰੂਕ ਨੌਜਵਾਨ ਵੀ ਪੂਰੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਕਿਸਮਤ ਬਦਲ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੇ ਇੱਕ ਸ਼ਾਂਤ ਪਿੰਡ ਨੂਰਪੁਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਬੁੱਢਾ ਡਾਕੀਆ ਰਹਿੰਦਾ ਸੀ ਜਿਸਦਾ ਨਾਮ ਹਰਭਜਨ ਸਿੰਘ ਸੀ। ਉਹ ਪਿਛਲੇ ਚਾਲੀ ਸਾਲਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਪਿੰਡ-ਪਿੰਡ ਚਿੱਠੀਆਂ ਵੰਡਦਾ ਆ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ। ਉਸਦੇ ਹੱਥਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੁਣ ਕਾਂਪ ਸੀ ਪਰ ਦਿਲ ਅਜੇ ਵੀ ਆਪਣੀ ਡਿਊਟੀ ਲਈ ਪੂਰੀ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਸਮਰਪਿਤ ਸੀ; ਲੋਕ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇਜ਼ਤ ਨਾਲ ਵੇਖਦੇ ਸਨ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਹ ਕਦੇ ਵੀ ਕਿਸੇ ਦੀ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਦੇਰ ਨਾਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਉਂਦਾ ਸੀ। ਇੱਕ ਦਿਨ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਪੁਰਾਣਾ ਲਫਾਫਾ ਮਿਲਿਆ ਜਿਸ ਉੱਤੇ ਲਿਖਿਆ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਤੁਰੰਤ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਈ ਜਾਵੇ। ਪਰ ਪਤਾ ਅਧੂਰਾ ਸੀ। ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਨਾਮ ਲਿਖਿਆ ਸੀ &quot;ਕੁਲਦੀਪ&quot; ਹਰਭਜਨ ਸਿੰਘ ਹੈਰਾਨ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਪਿੰਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਈ ਕੁਲਦੀਪ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ। ਉਸਨੇ ਫੈਸਲਾ ਕੀਤਾ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਇਸ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਨੂੰ ਸਹੀ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚਾ ਕੇ ਹੀ ਰਹੇਗਾ। ਉਹ ਪਿੰਡ ਦੇ ਹਰ ਕੁਲਦੀਪ ਨੂੰ ਮਿਲਣ ਗਿਆ। ਕਈਆਂ ਨੇ ਕਿਹਾ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਲਈ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ: ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਉਹ ਇੱਕ ਬੁਜ਼ੁਰਗ ਕੁਲਦੀਪ ਕੋਲ ਪਹੁੰਚਿਆ ਜੋ ਪਿੰਡ ਦੇ ਬਾਹਰ ਇਕ ਛੋਟੀ ਝੋਂਪੜੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਰਹਿੰਦਾ ਸੀ। ਉਸਦੀ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਅਜੀਬ ਜਿਹੀ ਉਦਾਸੀ ਸੀ। ਜਦੋਂ ਹਰਭਜਨ ਨੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਤਾਂ ਉਸਦੇ ਹੱਥ ਕਾਂਪਣ ਲੱਗੇ। ਚਿੱਠੀ ਉਸਦੀ ਬਚਪਨ ਦੀ ਦੋਸਤ ਦੀ ਸੀ ਜੋ ਕਈ ਸਾਲ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਵਿਦੇਸ਼ ਚਲੀ ਗਈ ਸੀ। ਉਸਨੇ ਲਿਖਿਆ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਬਹੁਤ ਬੀਮਾਰ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਦੇ ਆਖਰੀ ਦਿਨਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਬਚਪਨ ਦੇ ਦੋਸਤ ਕੁਲਦੀਪ ਨੂੰ ਆਖਰੀ ਵਾਰ ਮਿਲਣਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਉਸਨੇ ਲਿਖਿਆ ਸੀ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਅਜੇ ਵੀ ਨੂਰਪੁਰ ਦੇ ਦਿਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਯਾਦ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ— ਅਤੇ ਉਹ ਉਸਦੀ ਦੋਸਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਕਦੇ ਨਹੀਂ ਭੁੱਲੀ। ਕੁਲਦੀਪ ਦੀਆਂ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੰਝੂ ਆ ਗਏ। ਉਸਦਾ ਦਿਲ ਭਾਰੀ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ। ਉਸਨੂੰ ਅਹਿਸਾਸ ਹੋ ਗਿਆ ਕਿ ਹੁਣ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੀ ਦੋਸਤ ਨੂੰ ਕਦੇ ਨਹੀਂ ਮਿਲ ਸਕੇਗਾ। ਪਰ ਫਿਰ ਵੀ ਉਸਨੇ ਹਰਭਜਨ ਸਿੰਘ ਦਾ ਧੰਨਵਾਦ ਕੀਤਾ ਕਿ ਉਸਨੇ ਘੱਟੋ ਘੱਟ ਉਸਦਾ ਆਖਰੀ ਸੁਨੇਹਾ ਤਾਂ ਪਹੁੰਚਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ। ਹਰਭਜਨ ਸਿੰਘ ਉਸ ਝੋਂਪੜੀ ਤੋਂ ਨਿਕਲਦਿਆਂ ਬਹੁਤ ਸੋਚ ਵਿੱਚ ਡੁੱਬਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਸੀ। ਉਸਨੂੰ ਸਮਝ ਆ ਗਿਆ ਕਿ ਹਰ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਕਾਗਜ਼ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਉਹ ਕਿਸੇ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਦਾ ਹਿੱਸਾ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਉਸ ਦਿਨ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਉਸਨੇ ਆਪਣਾ ਕੰਮ ਹੋਰ ਵੀ ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾ ਪਿਆਰ; ਇਮਾਨਦਾਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਵੇਦਨਾ ਨਾਲ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਕਸਮ ਖਾ ਲਈ ਇਸ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਇੱਕ ਪੁਰਾਣੀ ਚਿੱਠੀ ਨੇ ਨਾ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਦੋ ਜਿੰਦਗੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਜੋੜਿਆ ਸਗੋਂ ਇਹ ਸਿਖਾ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਕਿ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜਜ਼ਬਾਤ ਸਮੇਂ ਅਤੇ ਦੂਰੀ ਤੋਂ ਕਦੇ ਨਹੀਂ ਹਾਰਦੇ।
