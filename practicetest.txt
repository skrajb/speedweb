In its thirty fifth flight (PSLV-C33), ISRO&apos;s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle successfully launched the 1425 kg IRNSS-1G, the seventh satellite in the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) today afternoon (April 28, 2016) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota. This is the thirty fourth consecutively successful mission of PSLV and the thirteenth in its &apos;XL&apos; configuration. Honourable Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, heartily thanked and congratulated all the ISRO scientist&apos;s and team ISRO for completing IRNSS constellation and dedicated IRNSS to the nation as &apos;NavIC&apos; (Navigation Indian Constellation). He appreciated India&apos;s space community for making the country proud through such achievements which have helped in improving the life of common man. After PSLV-C33 lift-off at 1250 hrs (12:50 pm) IST from the First Launch Pad with the ignition of  the first stage, the subsequent important flight events, namely, strap-on ignitions and separations, first stage separation, second stage ignition, heat-shield separation, second stage separation, third stage ignition and separation, fourth stage ignition and satellite injection, took place as planned. After a flight of 19 minutes 42 seconds, IRNSS-1G was injected into an elliptical orbit of 283 km X 20,718 km inclined at an angle of 17.867 degree to the equator (very close to the intended orbit) following which the satellite successfully separated from the PSLV fourth stage. After separation, the solar panels of IRNSS-1G were deployed automatically. ISRO&apos;s Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan, Karnataka took over the control of the satellite. In the coming days, four orbit manoeuvres will be conducted from MCF to position the satellite in the Geostationary Orbit at 129.5 deg East longitude. IRNSS-1G is the seventh of the seven satellites constituting the space segment of the Indian satellites are functioning satisfactorily from their designated orbital positions.

Time management is not merely about creating a schedule or filling up a planner with long lists of tasks. It is a mindset, a method of approaching our day in a disciplined, intentional, and thoughtful manner. Many people fail not because they lack talent or ambition, but because they spend their time reacting instead of planning, drifting instead of deciding, and racing instead of focusing. To master time management, one must first acknowledge that time is a limited resource. Every minute wasted is gone forever, while every minute invested holds the power to create results, skills, and progress.

The most effective individuals prioritize tasks based on importance rather than urgency. Urgency tricks us into believing that immediate action equals meaningful achievement. Importance reminds us that long-term impact matters more than short bursts of activity. Successful students, professionals, and entrepreneurs often begin their day by tackling their most meaningful task first, a technique known as “eating the frog.” It eliminates procrastination and builds momentum for the rest of the day.

Another essential principle in time management is the power of routines. Morning and evening routines create structure, reduce decision fatigue, and help maintain focus. When we automate small parts of our life, such as planning the next day before bed or reviewing our goals every morning, our brain is free to devote energy to creativity, learning, and problem-solving.

Equally important is learning to say no. Many people overload their schedules because they fear disappointing others. But every “yes” to a low-value activity is a “no” to something meaningful. Protecting your time means protecting your future.

Breaks are not the enemy of productivity; they are fuel for the mind. Short intervals of rest enhance concentration, prevent burnout, and boost creativity. Even the world&apos;s top performers follow cycles of work and rest.

Ultimately, time management is life management. When you manage your time well, you create space for growth, happiness, learning, and relationships. It is not about doing more but about doing what matters most. Every day gives us twenty-four hours. Some build dreams with them. Others let the hours pass quietly. The difference lies not in time, but in how we choose to use it.

Continuous learning is the foundation of modern success. In a rapidly changing world, where technology evolves each second and new opportunities appear daily, the willingness to learn has become more valuable than degrees, wealth, or background. Education does not end with school or college; true learning continues throughout life. The people who advance, innovate, and lead are those who stay curious and determined, treating every day as a chance to become better than before.

Learning today is easier than at any other point in history. With online courses, tutorials, books, virtual libraries, and expert communities, knowledge is available at our fingertips. A smartphone and a desire to grow are enough to build skills that once required expensive classrooms. Yet continuous learning is not simply about collecting knowledge; it is about practicing, experimenting, applying ideas, and refining skills through experience.

Humility is essential in this journey. A person who believes they already know everything stops growing. Successful learners are humble enough to ask questions, courageous enough to try new things, and strong enough to learn from failure. Mistakes are not setbacks; they are steppingstones. Every struggle builds resilience and wisdom.

Reading is one of the most powerful habits for self-development. Books allow us to absorb years of insight in a matter of hours. Conversations with knowledgeable people expand our perspectives. Online communities help us connect, collaborate, and solve problems together. The world is a classroom for those who choose to observe and engage.

Like muscles, the brain strengthens when challenged. Small daily efforts, whether in coding, writing, language, analysis, or leadership, compound into expertise. Continuous learning builds confidence, sharpens thinking, opens opportunities, and fuels growth. The day we stop learning is the day we stop rising. Stay curious, stay humble, and success will follow with quiet certainty.

In a recent article, &quot;English need not be the medium of instruction in higher education institutions&quot;, published in Sunday Guardian Live, Jagadesh Kumar, former Chairman of the UGC and former Vice-Chancellor of JNU, argues that the belief that English is essential for global communication and better job prospects has marginalised Indian languages in education. Citing the NEP 2020, which emphasises teaching in Indian languages as a key step toward greater inclusivity, Kumar calls for reducing English&apos;s dominance and highlights the challenges rural students face in coping with English. He argues that they should be allowed to take exams in their native language. The provocative title raises important questions. While it is true to an extent that using English as the medium of instruction can hinder students&apos; understanding of key concepts especially for those with limited English skills is it wise to argue that English should not be the medium in higher education institutions? Inspiring example I have come across numerous engineering students who initially struggled to understand and communicate in English. But the determined boy steadily improved his English skills, which boosted both his confidence and academic performance. While working full-time, he mastered design software and prepared rigorously for the GATE exam, ultimately securing an All India Rank of 16 and admission to IIT-MadrasEnglish is the global lingua franca. Proficiency in English has empowered millions of Indians to acquire knowledge and skills, succeed in higher education and their careers, compete with professionals worldwide, demonstrate expertise across diverse fields, and actively participate in the global economy. Moreover, strong English skills are a key requirement in the workplace. An English-medium education at the tertiary level significantly improves chances of securing better job opportunities.

Ancient India stands as one of the most remarkable and enduring civilizations in human history, flourishing across thousands of years from the prehistoric era to the decline of the % Gupta Empire around 600 CE. Its origins trace back to early human settlements during the Stone Age, when people lived in caves, hunted animals, and gradually learned to cultivate land and domesticate animals. The transition to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods saw the rise of settled agricultural communities like MEHRGARH, where early evidence of wheat cultivation and cattle rearing emerged. This slow yet steady progress in human organization and ~craftsmanship laid the foundation for the first great urban civilization of the subcontinent; the Indus Valley Civilization: also known as the Harappan Civilization. The Indus Valley Civilization, which thrived between 3300 BCE and 1500 BCE, was one of the world&apos;s earliest examples of planned urban development. Its cities Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, Lothal, and Kalibangan featured well-laid streets, advanced drainage systems, public baths, granaries, and standardized weights and measures. The people were skilled artisans who worked with metals, beads, and seals, and they traded extensively with regions like Mesopotamia. Religious life seemed to revolve around the worship of nature and fertility symbols such as the Mother Goddess and Pashupati, an early form of Lord Shiva. Although the script of this civilization remains UNDECIPHERED, its art, architecture, and craftsmanship demonstrate a sophisticated society. However, the civilization eventually declined, possibly # due to environmental changes, river shifts, or invasions, giving way to a new era in Indian history the Vedic Age. The Vedic period, spanning from around 1500 BCE to 600 BCE, began with the arrival of Indo-Aryan tribes who settled along the rivers of Northwestern India.

Life is a Journey filled with Challenges, Victories, dreams, and endless possibilities. Every person on this planet holds within them a fire a spark of greatness that can transform ordinary existence into Extraordinary achievement. The most powerful truth about life is that success does not depend on luck or circumstances; it depends on mindset, belief, and consistent effort. The moment you decide to believe in yourself, you take the first step toward greatness. Many people fail not because they lack talent, but because they doubt their own potential. The World will try to limit you, people will discourage you, and situations will test you, but the one thing that must remain UNSHAKEN is your self-belief. Confidence is not Arrogance: it is faith in your ability to learn, to rise, and to keep going despite obstacles. &quot;Success is never about avoiding failure but about learning how to rise after every fall.&quot; True Success demands persistence. Life will often test your patience, your Willpower, and your Emotional Strength. There will be days when you feel like giving up, when nothing seems to go right, when every door appears closed. But those who persist, who keep walking even when the path is dark, are the ones who eventually reach their destination. Think of Colonel Sanders, who faced over a thousand rejections before someone believed in his chicken recipe. His story shows that persistence is more powerful than talent or luck. When you keep trying, you build momentum, and with momentum comes Success. No great dream- was ever achieved overnight; it takes years of dedication, discipline, and faith. Motivation might get you started, but discipline keeps-you-going. Discipline means doing what you know is right, even when you don&apos;t feel like it. It means waking up early, working hard, and staying consistent. The small daily habits you build today determine the greatness you achieve tomorrow. Every person dreams, but only those who turn their dreams into goals achieve them. A dream without a plan is just a wish. Walt Disney dreamed of a magical place where imagination came alive. That dream became Disneyland because he planned, worked, and never gave up, even when he was broke and ridiculed. Your dreams can become your reality if you back them with clear goals, a positive mindset, and @ unshakable effort. Remember, talent may open the first door, but hard work keeps it open. Cristiano Ronaldo is a living example his dedication, practice, and focus made him one of the greatest footballers of all time. Behind every success lies countless hours of unseen effort, sacrifices, and commitment. Success doesn&apos;t come to those who wait; it comes to those who work when no one is watching.

The human mind is the most powerful tool you have. If you fill it with positive thoughts, it will guide you toward success; if you fill it with doubt, it will lead you astray. Positivity is not about Ignoring reality but about focusing on possibilities instead of limitations. Oprah Winfrey was once told she wasn&apos;t fit for television, yet her positivity turned rejection into strength. She became one of the most influential women in the world. Positive thinking gives you the Courage to act, the patience to endure, and the WISDOM to see light in the darkest times. Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass; it&apos;s about learning to dance in the rain. Every Challenge, every hardship, and every failure prepares you for something greater. Courage is the bridge between dreams and achievement. Nothing worthwhile ever happens inside your comfort zone. Growth begins when you step into the Unknown. Elon Musk risked everything to create Space-X and Tesla when most people called him crazy. Today! he has changed the world because he dared to dream beyond fear. Courage does not mean the absence of fear; it means acting despite it. Every time you face fear, you grow stronger. The more risks you take, the more opportunities you create. Change may feel uncomfortable, but it&apos;s the only way to progress. Those who adapt and embrace change thrive, while those who resist it stay stuck. Life keeps evolving, and so must you. The key is to trust the process and believe that everything happens for a reason. Like a seed planted deep underground, Success takes time to sprout. You may not see the results immediately, but with patience, they will bloom.

Life is the most precious gift we have. It is the Journey, we all go through from birth to death, filled with experiences, lessons, emotions, and memories. Everyone&apos;s life is different, but we all have something in common the desire to live happily, find purpose, and make the most of our time on earth. Life is not just about growing up, going to school, working, and growing old. It is about discovering who we are, understanding our STRENGTHS and weaknesses, learning from our mistakes, and building meaningful relationships. Life gives us chances every day to improve ourselves, help others, and enjoy the beauty around us. From the moment we are born, we begin to learn. As children, we learn how to walk, talk, and interact with the world. Our family teaches us love, kindness, and discipline. As we grow, we go to school, meet friends, and discover our interests. School plays a big role in our lives, teaching us not just ACADEMIC Knowledge, but also how to work with others, manage time, and deal with challenges. Life becomes more beautiful when we learn to enjoy these little things. Stress, pain, and sadness are also part of life, but they are not permanent. Earthquakes often bring a serious risk of flooding, due to the fact that they can destroy natural or manmade barriers that hold water in place. Dams can be weakened to the point of failure, or toppled entirely, by an earthquake. The Water, previously restrained by the dam, will immediately follow gravity&apos;s path to lower ground, submerging, damaging, or sweeping away anything in its path.

Earthquakes along the ocean floor can cause tsunamis, giant tidal waves bringing immense destruction to coastal areas they hit. A similar phenomenon, called a seiche, can occur on lakes. Although! SEICHES are usually smaller than tsunamis, they are still capable of destroying lakefront property if the earthquake has sufficient force. Fires Earthquakes can also cause fires by pulling down power lines, ripping apart gas pipes, or toppling wood burning stoves or fireplaces. Although the resulting fires can vary in severity, their effect is often worsened as the earthquake disrupts emergency crew ability to extinguish them. The most obvious danger brought by earthquakes is shaking ground. Depending on its intensity, this motion itself can damage or destroy building materials, which get stretched and bent beyond their tolerances. The ground&apos;s movement can take the form of waves running along the surface of the ground. As the wave runs under a building, the structure can lean, potentially tipping over. Then, when the shaking stops, the ground often settles to a different level compared to where it was previously, causing buildings, roads, and other structures to become unstable, topple, or break apart. <LIQUEFACTION> is particularly common in places with sandy soil and groundwater at shallow depths in the soil. Displacement along Fault Lines When an area containing a fault line gets hit by an earthquake, the land can break into new masses, separated by the fault line. Structures that were built across the fault will then be cleaved apart. If a road, for example, happens to cross the fault line, it can be sliced apart at the fault, with the two new pieces separated by a chasm or even pushed past each other, depending on the movement of the earth&apos;s plates. As the soil firms, the building will stop settling and come to rest in its altered position.

Friends we make during this time often stay with us for life and help us understand the value of trust and support. Life teaches us many lessons outside of books. We learn to deal with failures, disappointments, and Setbacks. Not everything in life goes as planned, and that is okay. Failure is not the end but a step toward Success. Every time we fall, we have a chance to rise again, stronger and wiser. These Experiences make us mature and teach us to stay strong in difficult times. They also help us understand that problems are a part of life, and how we face them defines who we are. One of the most important things in life is relationships. Our family, friends, teachers, and even strangers we meet all play a role in our Journey. Life becomes meaningful when we share it with others. Helping someone, showing kindness, or simply listening to someone&apos;s problems can bring great joy. Being kind and respectful to others creates a positive environment and brings peace to our own hearts. When we build strong relationships based on trust and love, we create a support system that helps us through the ups and downs of life. Life is also about personal growth. Infrastructure is the network of power, telecom, ports, airports, roads, Civil Aviation, railways, and transportation in a country. Its importance in the development of a Country cannot be over-emphasised. As a matter of fact infrastructure is the lifeline of the economy of a country. All developed countries have adequate infrastructure so that all the activities are executed efficiently, smoothly in time. On the other hand, all poor countries have little infrastructure. The plans of these countries target the building of adequate infrastructure to put their economies on a high growth path.

Power is an essential input for economic development and improving the quality of life of people. Development of conventional forms of energy for meeting the growing needs of people is the responsibility of the government. In the pre- independence period, the power supply was mainly in the private sector and that too restricted to the urban areas. With the formation of State Electricity Boards during the Five-Year Plans, a significant step was taken in bringing about a systematic growth of power supply for industries all over the country. A number of multi-purpose projects came into being with the setting up of hydro, thermal and nuclear power stations. India at present is at the threshold of becoming a developed country. With the increase in population the demand for goods and services is increasing every year. The number of dwelling units in big and small cities is increasing. There is more demand for power to run home appliances in these as well as existing units. To meet this ever increasing demand we need to build a huge power infrastructure. That is why India has entered into a nuclear deal with America whereby the sole superpower in the world shall provide us with nuclear technology. Many nuclear reactors will be set up in India. The transportation infrastructure includes roads, vehicles, railways, tracks, trains, ports, airports, ships and vessels. Road transportation is perhaps the most important because the railway tracks cannot be laid everywhere. The roads are the means by which the movement of people and goods from one place to another is ensured.

According to an estimate approximately eight million Indians are living in countries of the world. Although America, France, England, Australia are their favourite countries, and middle-east and south-east Asia are their other favourite regions, the persons of Indian origin are scattered in all parts of the world. They are in several countries of Africa, the Scandinavian countries, Benelux countries, and the Caribbean island countries. In some countries they have mixed with the locals in such a way that at times it is difficult to differentiate them. In some nations, they have been living now for the last 2-3 generations assimilating local culture, language, habits and customs. Most of the Indians who are either working abroad or have permanently settled abroad have kept their roots intact. They are highly patriotic and love India as much as the resident Indians do. A vast majority of the people who have gone abroad from various parts of India have left their parents and other close relatives like brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, grandparents, etc. at their native place. Such Diasporas have properties and other assets in India and keep on sending money to their parents/ relatives regularly. They have opened various kinds of Non- Resident Accounts in different banks. Many well-off Non-Residents are participating in the private business ventures directly and indirectly. The current boom in India&apos;s share market, to some extent is due to the bulk share purchase of various listed companies by the NRIs. This is indirect participation in Indian industries. Some listed public sector enterprises are also favourite of these investors. It is also said that many NRIs are buying residential and commercial properties in India. The diaspora is particularly interested in buying offices, chambers and shops in multiplexes in metropolitan cities, state capitals, district centres and other major cities in India.

Dimensions on the Importance of Transformational Leadership in Education Educational institutions need leaders that would confront the status quo and use their power to deal with power imbalances in schools and communities. An effective leader must be willing to use the authority of democracy if he is to achieve an institution improvement. Leadership is a crucial element concerned with creating conditions in which institutional reforms can succeed including improving students learning and institution&apos;s image. Effective leaders are found to exercise an indirect but powerful influence on the effectiveness of the institution and on the achievement of students. Traditionally, a principal&apos;s role performance involves focusing on institutional goals, the curriculum, instruction and creating conducive institutional environment. The principal focuses on enhancing teacher&apos;s performance and on the behaviours of teachers so as to enable teachers to engage their students in learning activities which ultimately focus on helping students learn. Thus, principal&apos;s leadership is thought to be instrumental in bringing about institutional effectiveness. This traditional approach to leadership is known as instructional leadership. The term instructional leadership emerged from institutional effectiveness research in the 1980s. However, instructional leadership suffers from some drawbacks. Dimmock (1995) asserts that instructional leadership is too prescriptive and relies on a top-down process of management. This type of structure supports the view that when principals accomplish vital tasks, teaching and learning improve. He suggests that institutions are characterized by loose coupling and autonomy and a better strategy would be a bottom-up approach.

The proposed backward mapping would begin with student-outcomes and then progress through the following: learning styles and processes, teaching strategies, institutional organization and structure, leadership, management, resources and culture/climate. Dimmock further suggests that this framework and strategy would help institutions and communities address the challenge of providing leadership and management for quality teaching and learning. Essentially, the student is the centre of institutions, which are deeply concerned with quality of institution and principals and teachers must focus on improving student learning and performance. Leadership within this paradigm is based primarily on a strong technical knowledge of pedagogy/andragogy and secondly, on curriculum design, development and evaluation. Saving money is also a habit that can help us in the future. We should learn not to waste money on unnecessary things. Instead, we can save a little every day or week. This money can be used in times of need or for something important later. Saving teaches us patience and planning. It is a habit that even grown-ups must follow to lead a stable life. In the modern world, using technology wisely is a new good habit we must learn. Mobile phones, computers, and the internet are useful, but we should not spend too much time on them. Too much screen time can harm our eyes and reduce our focus. We should use gadgets for learning and communication, but not become addicted to games or social media.

### English

Honesty is another powerful habit. Being honest means always telling the truth and being fair in our actions. An honest person is trusted by others and has a clean conscience. Honesty builds strong relationships and earns respect from friends, teachers, and family members. When we lie or cheat, we may get something for a @ short time, but we lose respect and trust, which are more valuable. Kindness is a habit that makes the world a better place. When we are kind to others, we spread happiness and create a positive environment. Even small acts of kindness like helping a Classmate; sharing food, or saying kind words can make someone&apos;s day. Kindness is free, but it brings great value. When we are kind, we make more friends and feel good about ourselves. Another good habit is reading books. Reading helps us gain Knowledge, learn new ideas, and improve our VOCABULARY. Books open our minds and let us experience things beyond our everyday life. Reading also improves our focus, memory, and creativity. Students who read regularly do better in their studies because they can understand subjects more easily. Reading also makes us better speakers and writers. All essays on American culture generally explore the # Customs and traditions of the USA, a Country with distinct cultural background encompassing food preferences, language, religious affiliation and much more. American Culture would be of great interest to everyone who is fond of learning new things about the world around. Current American culture essay will discuss the most peculiar aspects of the US customs and traditions.

Respecting elders and teachers is also a habit that helps us grow. Elders have more experience, and their advice can guide us in the right direction. Teachers work hard to help us learn, and we should always listen to them with attention and respect. Using polite words like &quot;please,&quot; &quot;thank you,&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; also shows that we have good manners. These small words can solve big problems and help maintain peace. Another very useful habit is saving money. We should learn to save from a young age. Saving money helps us in emergencies and allows us to buy things we need later. Instead of spending money on things we don&apos;t need, we can keep some aside in a piggy bank or savings account. This habit teaches self-control and responsibility. Even adults benefit from saving, as it helps them manage their finances and plan for the future. In today&apos;s World! wise use of technology is a very important habit. Mobile phones, Computers, and the Internet are very helpful tools, but if we use them too much, they can become harmful. Spending too much time on screens can hurt our eyes, reduce our focus, and take away time from other important activities. Education has continued to evolve, diversify and extend its reach and Coverage since the dawn of human history. Every country develops its system of education to express and promote its unique Socio-cultural identity and also to meet the challenges of the times. There are moments in history when a new direction has to be given to an age-old process. That moment is today. The Country has reached a stage in its economic and technical development when a major effort must be made to derive the maximum benefit from the assets already created and to ensure that the fruits of change reach all sections.

Education is the highway to that goal. Prevelance of Child labour: All non-school going children are child workers in one form or the other. Agricultural child labour constitutes the core of the problem. Child labour policies and education policies have to be formulated and operated in tandem. Parents do want to send their children to be educated and poverty as a limiting factor is highly OVER+RATED. Motivation and availability of infrastructure rather than poverty are the key factors. The paper underlines the strengths of formal education in eradicating child labour and forcefully argues for a legislation to provide for compulsory education. The main argument against child labour and compulsory education is that it is necessary for the wellbeing of the poor as the state is unable to provide relief. The second argument, is that education would make the poor unsuited: for the kind of manual work that is required to be done. The third argument is that certain industries would be forced to close down if they did not have the facility of the low wage child labour. The Country has reached a stage in its economic and technical development when a major effort must be made to derive the maximum benefit from the assets already created and to ensure that the fruits of change reach all sections.

We should use technology for learning, connecting with others, and doing work, but not for wasting time. Setting time limits for games and social media is a good habit to follow. Another good habit that makes a big difference is helping others. This can be helping our parents at home, supporting our classmates in school, or helping neighbors in the community. It teaches us the value of empathy and COOPERATION. When we help others, we also feel more confident and useful. It creates a caring and friendly environment around us. Being positive and staying calm in difficult situations is also a good habit. Life is not always easy, and we may face challenges.

It is a habit that leads to inner peace and better decision-making. Learning and practicing good habits takes time, but it is worth the effort. We can start with small steps, like making our bed every morning, saying thank you, or finishing our homework before playing. Slowly! these habits become part of our daily routine. Each year, new technologies hold the promise to alter the way we think and learn. Computers are prevalent everywhere, and they are making their way into school systems around the country. It is obvious that there is a demand for technological instruction in high school and college. However, the question of if computers should be implemented into early childhood classrooms is still prudent. With Computers all around us, it is Inevitable that children will be exposed to them, and they will eventually be facilitated into their daily lives. The purpose of this research paper is to explore the advantages, disadvantages, and methods of integrating computers into the early childhood classroom.

“ਜੀਵਨ ਖੇਤਰ ਦੀ ਲੀਲ੍ਹਾ ਵੀ ਅਜਬ ਹੈ। ਸਤਿਗੁਰਾ ਇਸ ਨੂੰ ਛਿੰਜ ਦਾ ਅਖਾੜਾ ਕਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਗਿਆਨ ਦਾ ਮਾਇਆ ਨਾਲ, ਬੁਧ ਦਾ ਜੜ੍ਹਤਾ ਨਾਲ, ਉਤਸ਼ਾਹ ਦਾ ਭਰਮਾਦ ਨਾਲ, ਵਾਧੇ ਦਾ ਘਾਟੇ ਤੇ ਪੁੰਨ ਦਾ ਪਾਪ ਨਾਲ ਘੋਲ ਹੋ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ।” ਇਹਨਾਂ ਦੋਹਾਂ ਹੀ ਸੰਪਰਦਾਵਾਂ ਦੇ ਦੋ ਮੁਖੀ ਮਨੁੱਖਤਾ ਤੇ ਬਦੀ ਮੰਨੇ ਗਏ ਹਨ। ਮਨੁੱਖਤਾ ਉਤਾਂਹ ਉਠਣਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਬਦੀ ਰੋਕ ਪਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਹ੍ਹ,ਰ੍ਰ,ਵ੍ਵ ਹਰ ਬੀਜ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਫੁਟੇ ਅੰਕੁਰ ਨੂੰ, ਬੂਟਾ ਬਣਨ ਲਈ ਮਿੱਟੀ ਦੀ ਤਹਿ ਤੋੜ ਕੇ ਹੀ ਉਠਣਾ ਪੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। @ਇਹ ਘੋਲ ਰਚਨਾ ਦੇ ਅਰੰਭ ਤੋਂ ਚਲਿਆ ਆ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਮਾਲਕ ਦੀ ਮਰਜ਼ੀ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਅਖਾੜਾ ਰਚਿਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਉਹ ਆਪ ਬੈਠਾ ਇਸ ਤਮਾਸ਼ੇ ਨੂੰ ਦੇਖ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਬਾਈਬਲ ਤੇ ਉਸ ਦੇ ਸਾਥੀ ਕੁਰਾਨ ਨੇ ਇਸ ਮੁਢਲੇ ਬਦੀ ਦੇ ਜਜ਼ਬੇ ਨੂੰ ਇਕ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਮੰਨਿਆ ਹੈ। ±ਖ਼ਿਆਲ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਪਹਿਲੇ ਮਨੁੱਖ, ਆਦਮ ਦੀ ਪੈਦਾਇਸ਼ ਤੋਂ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਫ਼ਰਿਸ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਮਖ਼ਲੂਕ ਮੌਜੂਦ ਸੀ। ਮਨੁੱਖ ਖ਼ਾਕ ਤੋਂ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਉਹ ਨੂਰ ਤੋਂ ਬਣਾਏ ਗਏ ਸਨ। ਉਹ ਹਰ ਵਕਤ ਖ਼ੁਦਾ ਦੀ ਬੰਦਗੀ ਵਿਚ ਲਗੇ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਸਨ। ਪਰ ਰੱਬ ਨੂੰ ਅਜਿਹੀ ਬੰਦਗੀ, ^ਜਿਸ ਦਾ ਬਦੀ ਨਾਲ ਕੋਈ ਵਾਹ ਹੀ ਨਾ ਪਵੇ, ਜੋ ਬੁਰਾਈ ਨਾਲ ਘੁਲ, ਉਸ ਨੂੰ ਪਛਾੜ, ਜਿਤ ਘਰ ਨਾ ਆਵੇ, ਕੁਝ ਪਸੰਦ ਨਾ ਆਈ। ਉਸਨੇ ਖ਼ਾਕੀ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਬਣਾਇਆ ਤੇ ਫ਼ਰਿਸ਼ਤਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਕਿਹਾ ½ ਕਿ ਇਹਦੇ ਅਗੇ ਸਿਜਦਾ ਕਰੋ। ੩੧੮੯ ਉਹ ਰੱਬ ਦੀ ਆਗਿਆ ਮੰਨ ਸਿਜਦੇ ਵਿਚ ਡਿਗ ਪਏ, ਪਰ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੇ ਸ਼੍ਰੋਮਣੀ ‘ਅਜ਼ਾਜ਼ੀਲ’ ਨੇ ਇਸ ਹੁਕਮ ਦੇ ਵਿਰੁੱਧ ਰੋਸ ਪ੍ਰਗਟ ਕੀਤਾ ਕਿ ਅਸੀਂ ਨੂਰੀ ਹਾਂ, ਸਾਥੋਂ ਖ਼ਾਕੀ ਅਗੇ ਸਿਜਦਾ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਕਿਉਂ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ ਨੇ ਵੀ ਉਸ ਦਿਨ ਤੋਂ ਪ੍ਰਣ ਕਰ ਲਿਆ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਆਦਮ ਦੀ ਔਲਾਦ ਨੂੰ ਪਰਮੇਸ਼੍ਵਰ ਵਲੋਂ ਗੁਮਰਾਹ ਕਰੇਗਾ, ਉਸਨੂੰ ਨੇਕੀ ਵਲੋਂ ਹਟਾ ਬਦੀ ਵੱਲ ਜੋੜੇਗਾ ਤੇ ਸੁਰਗ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਕਢਾ ਦੋਜ਼ਖ਼ ਵਿਚ ਪਾ ਕੇ ਛੋੜੇਗਾ– ਚੁਨਾਂਚਿ ਉਸ ਦਿਨ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ ਨੇ ਆਪਣਾ ਕੰਮ ਅਰੰਭ ਦਿੱਤਾ। ‘ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਹਵਾ ਨੂੰ ਭਰਮਾ, ਫਿਰ ਉਸਦੇ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਆਦਮ ਕੋਲੋਂ ਪਰਮੇਸ਼੍ਵਰ ਦੀ ਹੁਕਮ ਅਦੂਲੀ ਕਰਾਈ ਤੇ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਮਨ੍ਹਾ ਕੀਤੇ ਹੋਏ ਬੂਟੇ ਦਾ ਫਲ ਖਵਾ ਬਹਿਸ਼ਤ ਵਿਚੋਂ ਕਢਵਾਇਆ ਤੇ ਅੱਜ ਤਕ ਆਦਮ ਦੀ ਔਲਾਦ ਨੂੰ ਬਹਿਕਾਂਦਾ ਚਲਾ ਆ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ।’ ਯਵਨੀ ਮਤਾਂ ਦੇ ਇਸ ਅਕੀਦੇ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ, ਸੰਸਾਰ ਦੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਪੁਰਾਣੇ ਮਤ, ਪਾਰਸੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਵੀ ਇਸ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਲਦਾ ਜੁਲਦਾ ਖ਼ਿਆਲ ਹੈ। ‘ਯਸਦਾਨ’ ਤੇ ‘ਅਹਿਰਮਨ’। ਯਸਦਾਨ ਨੇਕੀ ਦੀ © ਪ੍ਰੇਰਨਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਤੇ ਅਹਿਰਮਨ ਬਦੀ ਦੀ। ਇਹ ਦੋਵੇਂ ਨੇਕੀ ਤੇ ਬਦੀ ਦੇ ਦੇਵਤੇ ਪਹਿਲੇ ਦਿਨ ਤੋਂ ਬਰਾਬਰ ਹੀ ਤੁਰੇ ਆਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਥੇ ਸ਼ੈਤਾਨ ਕੋਈ ਪਰਮੇਸ਼੍ਵਰ ਦੇ ਅਧੀਨ ਤੇ ਉਸਦਾ ਸਰਾਪਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਫ਼ਰਿਸ਼ਤਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ, ਸਗੋਂ ਬਰਾਬਰ ਦੀ ਤਾਕਤ ਹੈ ਤੇ ੴ ਯਸਦਾਨ ਦੇ ਬਰਾਬਰ ਹੀ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਬਦੀ ਵਲ ਪ੍ਰੇਰਨਾ ਕਰ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ।

ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਯੁੱਗ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦੀ ਮੂਲ ਭੂਮਿਕਾ ਸਿਰਫ ਪਾਠਕ੍ਰਮਿਕ ਗਿਆਨ ਤੱਕ ਸੀਮਿਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹਿ ਗਈ, ਸਗੋਂ ਇਹ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਜੀਵਨ ਜੀਉਣ ਦੇ ਸਹੀ ਢੰਗ, ਆਤਮ-ਨਿਰਭਰਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਸਵੈ-ਅਧਿਐਨ ਦੀ ਭਾਵਨਾ ਵਿਕਸਤ ਕਰਨ ਵੱਲ ਵੀ ਧਿਆਨ ਕੇਂਦਰਿਤ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਅੱਜ ਦੇ ਸਮੇਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਵੈ-ਅਧਿਐਨ ਦੀ ਯੋਗਤਾ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ, ਉਹ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਸਪਰਧਾ ਜਾਂ ਚੁਣੌਤੀ ਦਾ ਸਾਹਮਣਾ ਆਸਾਨੀ ਨਾਲ ਕਰ ਲੈਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਸਵੈ-ਅਧਿਐਨ ਉਹ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਵਿਸ਼ਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਪੜ੍ਹਨ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਬਿਨਾਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਦੀ ਨਿਗਰਾਨੀ ਜਾਂ ਮਦਦ ਤੋਂ। ਇਹ ਇੱਕ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਨੂੰ ਨਿਰਭਰ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਗਿਆਨ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਨੂੰ ਸਮਝੇ। ਆਤਮ-ਨਿਰਭਰਤਾ ਵੀ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਾ ਇੱਕ ਅਹੰਕਾਰਪੂਰਕ ਪੱਖ ਹੈ। ਆਤਮ-ਨਿਰਭਰ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਉਹ ਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ ਜੋ ਆਪਣੇ ਲਕੜਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਖੁਦ ਪਛਾਣਦੇ ਹਨ, ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਹੱਲ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਰਾਹ ਲੱਭਦੇ ਹਨ, ਅਤੇ ਕਿਸੇ ਹੋਰ ਦੀ ਉਡੀਕ ਕੀਤੇ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਕੰਮ ਨੂੰ ਪੂਰਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਅਜਿਹੇ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਿਰਫ ਅਕਾਦਮਿਕ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਗੋਂ ਵਿਅਕਤੀਗਤ ਅਤੇ ਪੇਸ਼ਾਵਰ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਉੱਚੀਆਂ ਉੱਚਾਈਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਛੂਹਣ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਾਮਯਾਬ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਆਤਮ-ਨਿਰਭਰਤਾ ਇੱਕ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਗੁਣ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੇ ਹਰ ਪੱਖ ਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਿਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਜੇਕਰ ਕੋਈ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਅਧਿਐਨ ਦੀ ਯੋਜਨਾ ਬਣਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਆਪਣੇ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਲਕੜਾਂ ਤੈਅ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਆਪਣੀਆਂ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰੀਆਂ ਦੀ ਪਛਾਣ ਕਰਕੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ 'ਤੇ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਉਹ ਆਤਮ-ਨਿਰਭਰਤਾ ਵੱਲ ਵਧ ਰਹਿਆ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਵੈ-ਅਧਿਐਨ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਦੀ ਆਜ਼ਾਦੀ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਰੁਚੀ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਵਿਸ਼ਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਚੋਣ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ। ਉਦਾਹਰਨ ਵਜੋਂ, ਜੇਕਰ ਕਿਸੇ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਨੂੰ ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਰੁਚੀ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਉਹ ਆਪਣੀ ਰੁਚੀ ਦੇ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਵੱਖ-ਵੱਖ ਇਤਿਹਾਸਕ ਦਸਤਾਵੇਜ਼ਾਂ, ਕਿਤਾਬਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਡਿਜੀਟਲ ਸਰੋਤਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਗਿਆਨ ਲੈ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇੱਥੇ ਸਵੈ-ਅਧਿਐਨ ਦੀ ਕਲਾ ਉਸ ਨੂੰ ਹੋਰ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਤੋਂ ਅੱਗੇ ਲੈ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਉਹ ਕਿਸੇ ਨਿਰਧਾਰਤ ਹਦ ਤੱਕ ਸੀਮਿਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੁੰਦਾ। ਸਵੈ-ਅਧਿਐਨ ਦੀ ਪ੍ਰਕਿਰਿਆ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਮਾਂ ਪ੍ਰਬੰਧਨ ਸਿਖਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉਹ ਆਪਣੇ ਦਿਨ ਦੀ ਯੋਜਨਾ ਬਣਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਪਾਠਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੂਚੀ ਤਿਆਰ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਆਪਣੀ ਅਗਰਤਾ ਅਨੁਸਾਰ ਅਧਿਐਨ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ।

ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਜੀਵਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦਾ ਅਹੰਕਾਰਪੂਰਕ ਸਥਾਨ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਉਹੀ ਮਾਧਿਅਮ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਆਪਣੇ ਲਕੜੇ ਨੂੰ ਪੂਰਾ ਕਰ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੇ ਬਿਨਾ ਜੀਵਨ ਅਧੂਰਾ ਅਤੇ ਨਿਸ਼ਪ੍ਰਭ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਸਫਲਤਾ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਵਿਅਕਤੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਪੈਰ ਚੁੰਮਦੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਆਦਤ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦਾ ਅਰਥ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸ਼ਰੀਰਕ ਕੰਮ ਨਹੀਂ, ਬਲਕਿ ਮਾਨਸਿਕ ਲਗਨ, ਸਮਰਪਣ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ ਭਰੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਵੀ ਹੈ। ਇਤਿਹਾਸ ਗਵਾਹ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਜਿਹੜੇ ਲੋਕ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨੂੰ ਆਪਣੀ ਧਰਮ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਉਹੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੇ ਸ਼ਿਖਰ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚਦੇ ਹਨ। ਮਿਸਾਲ ਵਜੋਂ ਅਮਰੀਕਾ ਦੇ ਰਾਸ਼ਟਰਪਤੀ ਅਬਰਾਹਮ ਲਿੰਕਨ, ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਗਰੀਬੀ, ਅਸਮਰਥਤਾ ਅਤੇ ਵਿਪਰੀਤ ਹਾਲਾਤਾਂ ਦੇ ਬਾਵਜੂਦ ਆਪਣੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਸਾਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਆਪਣਾ ਨਾਮ ਬਣਾਇਆ। ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨੇ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਕਿ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ਾਂ ਦੇ ਰਾਹ ਤੋਂ ਗੁਜ਼ਰ ਕੇ ਹੀ ਮਨਜ਼ਿਲ ਮਿਲਦੀ ਹੈ। ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਵਧੀਆ ਨੌਕਰੀ, ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਵਧੀਆ ਅੰਕ, ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਖੇਡਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੈਡਲ ਅਤੇ ਕਿਸੇ ਲਈ ਨਾਮ ਤੇ ਇੱਜ਼ਤ। ਪਰ ਇਹ ਸਾਰੀਆਂ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤੀਆਂ ਇੱਕ ਹੀ ਆਧਾਰ 'ਤੇ ਨਿਰਭਰ ਕਰਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ – ਅਤੇ ਉਹ ਹੈ ਮਿਹਨਤ। ਇਕ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਜੋ ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਇਮਤਿਹਾਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਚੰਗੇ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਲਿਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਖਿਡਾਰੀ ਜੋ ਦਿਨ-ਰਾਤ ਅਭਿਆਸ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਓਹੀ ਆਖ਼ਰਕਾਰ ਮੈਡਲ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਆਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਵਿਗਿਆਨੀ ਜੋ ਰਾਤਾਂ ਜਾਗ ਕੇ ਤਜਰਬੇ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਉਹੀ ਨਵੀਂ ਖੋਜ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਥੋਮਸ ਐਡਿਸਨ ਨੇ ਲਾਈਟ ਬਲਬ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਹਜ਼ਾਰ ਵਾਰ ਅਸਫਲਤਾ ਸਹੀ ਪਰ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਛੱਡੀ, ਜੋ ਅੱਜ ਚਾਨਣ ਬਣੀ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਨਾ ਅਸਾਨ ਨਹੀਂ, ਇਹ ਇੱਕ ਅਭਿਆਸ, ਆਦਤ ਅਤੇ ਮਨੋਵਿਗਿਆਨਿਕ ਤਿਆਰੀ ਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਕਰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਆਧੁਨਿਕ ਸਮੇਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਇੰਟਰਨੈਟ, ਆਰਟੀਫੀਸ਼ੀਅਲ ਇੰਟੈਲੀਜੈਂਸ ਅਤੇ ਨਵੀਂ ਤਕਨਾਲੋਜੀ ਆ ਚੁੱਕੀ ਹੈ, ਉਥੇ ਵੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਘੱਟ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੋਈ। ਹੁਣ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੇ ਰੂਪ ਬਦਲੇ ਹਨ – ਪਰ ਮਤਲਬ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦਾ ਅਜੇ ਵੀ “ਲਗਨ ਅਤੇ ਸੰਘਰਸ਼” ਹੀ ਹੈ। ਆਨਲਾਈਨ ਕੰਮ, ਕੋਡਿੰਗ, ਡਿਜ਼ਾਈਨ, ਡਿਜੀਟਲ ਮਾਰਕੇਟਿੰਗ ਆਦਿ ਨਵੇਂ ਖੇਤਰ ਹਨ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਰੋਜ਼ਾਨਾ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਚੁਣੌਤੀਆਂ ਆਉਂਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ – ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਨਿਭਣ ਲਈ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਗਿਆਨ ਨਹੀਂ, ਸਖ਼ਤ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਵੀ ਚਾਹੀਦੀ ਹੈ। ਸਮਾਜਿਕ ਤੌਰ ਤੇ ਵੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੀ ਮਹੱਤਤਾ ਘੱਟ ਨਹੀਂ।

ਇੱਕ ਮਾਸਟਰ ਜੋ ਮਨ ਲਾ ਕੇ ਪੜ੍ਹਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਉਹ ਕਈ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਆਂ ਦੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਬਦਲ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇੱਕ ਡਾਕਟਰ ਜੋ ਦਿਨ-ਰਾਤ ਮਰੀਜ਼ਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੇਵਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਉਹ ਸਚਮੁਚ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੇ ਉੱਚੇ ਦਰਜੇ 'ਤੇ ਖੜਾ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਗੁਰੂ ਨਾਨਕ ਦੇਵ ਜੀ ਨੇ ਵੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਾਲ ਕਮਾਈ ਗੁਜਾਰਨ ਦੀ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਦਿੱਤੀ। ਉਹ ਕਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ – “ਘਾਲਿ ਖਾਇ ਕਿਛੁ ਹਥਹੁ ਦੇਇ, ਨਾਨਕ ਰਾਹੁ ਪਛਾਣਹਿ ਸੇਈ।” ਇਹ ਸਿੱਖਿਆ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਦੱਸਦੀ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਸਚੀ ਜ਼ਿੰਦਗੀ ਉਹੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਕੇ ਖਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਸੇਵਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਕਈ ਵਾਰੀ ਲੋਕ ਸੋਚਦੇ ਹਨ ਕਿ ਕਿਸਮਤ ਨਾਲ ਹੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਮਿਲਦੀ ਹੈ। ਪਰ ਇਹ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਧਾਰਨਾ ਹੈ – ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਜੋ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਕਿਸਮਤ 'ਤੇ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ ਕਰਕੇ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰਦਾ, ਉਹ ਅਖੀਰਕਾਰ ਪਛਤਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਉਲਟ, ਜੋ ਲੋਕ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਉਹ ਆਪਣੀ ਕਿਸਮਤ ਖੁਦ ਲਿਖਦੇ ਹਨ। ਜਿਵੇਂ ਮਾਸਟਰ ਕਰਤਾਰ ਸਿੰਘ ਸਰਾਬ੍ਹਾ ਨੇ ਨੌਜਵਾਨੀ ਵਿੱਚ ਹੀ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਜਜ਼ਬਾ ਵਿਖਾਇਆ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਸਦੀ ਦੇ ਹੀਰੋ ਬਣ ਗਏ – ਇਹ ਮਿਹਨਤ; ਸੰਘਰਸ਼ ਅਤੇ ਬਲਿਦਾਨ ਦੀ ਮਿਸਾਲ ਹੈ। ਪੀ.ਵੀ. ਸਿੰਧੂ ਨੇ ਬੈਡਮਿੰਟਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਜਿਹੀ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕੀਤੀ ਕਿ ਦੁਨੀਆ ਨੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਲਾਮ ਕੀਤਾ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਕੁਝ ਹੋਰ ਗੁਣ ਵੀ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹਨ – ਸਮੇਂ ਦੀ ਕਦਰ, ਦਿਸ਼ਾ ਦਾ ਚੋਣ, ਆਤਮ-ਵਿਸ਼ਵਾਸ; ਅਨੁਸ਼ਾਸਨ ਅਤੇ ਧੀਰਜ। ਜੇਕਰ ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਗੁਣਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਜੋੜੀ ਜਾਵੇ, ਤਾਂ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਨੂੰ ਰੋਕਣਾ ਔਖਾ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹੀ ਕਾਰਨ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਅਸਲ ਸਫਲ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਉਹ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਚੁਪ ਚਾਪ, ਲਗਾਤਾਰ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਹਰ ਦਿਨ ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨੂੰ ਬਿਹਤਰ ਬਣਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਹਮੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਕੁਝ ਨਵਾਂ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਅੰਤ ਵਿੱਚ, ਇਹ ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਹੀ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਦੀ ਕੁੰਜੀ ਹੈ। ਜਿਸ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਬੀਜ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਪੌਧਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਉਗਦਾ, ਉਸੇ ਤਰ੍ਹਾਂ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਤੋਂ ਬਿਨਾਂ ਸਫਲਤਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਮਿਲਦੀ। ਇਹ ਇੱਕ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਹਥਿਆਰ ਹੈ ਜਿਸ ਨਾਲ ਮਨੁੱਖ ਆਪਣੇ ਜੀਵਨ ਦੀ ਹਰ ਮੁਸ਼ਕਿਲ ਨੂੰ ਹਰਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਮਿਹਨਤ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਸਰੀਰਕ ਕੰਮ ਨਹੀਂ, ਇਹ ਮਨ, ਦਿਲ ਅਤੇ ਆਤਮਾ ਦੀ ਸ਼ੁੱਧਤਾ ਵੀ ਹੈ। ਅਸੀਂ ਜੇ ਅੱਜ ਤੋਂ ਹੀ ਆਪਣੀ ਦਿਸ਼ਾ ਨੂੰ ਸਹੀ ਕਰਕੇ ਮਿਹਨਤ ਕਰਨੀ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰੀਏ, ਤਾਂ ਕੱਲ੍ਹ ਸਾਡਾ ਹੋਵੇਗਾ।
